Abstract

   Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane using a new
   type of Routing Extension Header called the Segment Routing Header
   (SRH).  This document describes the SRH and how it is used by nodes
   that are Segment Routing (SR) capable.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Segment Routing (SR) can be applied to the IPv6 data plane using a
   new type of routing header called the Segment Routing Header (SRH).
   This document describes the SRH and how it is used by nodes that are
   SR capable.

   &quot;Segment Routing Architecture&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8402" title="&quot;Segment Routing Architecture&quot;">RFC8402</a>] describes Segment Routing
   and its instantiation in two data planes: MPLS and IPv6.

   The encoding of IPv6 segments in the SRH is defined in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   This document uses the terms Segment Routing (SR), SR domain, SR over
   IPv6 (SRv6), Segment Identifier (SID), SRv6 SID, Active Segment, and
   SR Policy as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8402" title="&quot;Segment Routing Architecture&quot;">RFC8402</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Requirements Language</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Segment Routing Header</span>

   Routing headers are defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8200" title="&quot;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification&quot;">RFC8200</a>].  The Segment Routing Header
   (SRH) has a new Routing Type (4).

   The SRH is defined as follows:

   Segments Left:  Defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8200#section-4.4">[RFC8200], Section&nbsp;4.4</a>.

   Last Entry:  contains the index (zero based), in the Segment List, of
      the last element of the Segment List.

   Flags:  8 bits of flags.  <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a> creates an IANA registry for
      new flags to be defined.  The following flags are defined:

          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |U U U U U U U U|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      U: Unused and for future use.  MUST be 0 on transmission and
      ignored on receipt.

   Tag:  Tag a packet as part of a class or group of packets -- e.g.,
      packets sharing the same set of properties.  When Tag is not used
      at the source, it MUST be set to zero on transmission.  When Tag
      is not used during SRH processing, it SHOULD be ignored.  Tag is
      not used when processing the SID defined in <a href="#section-4.3.1">Section 4.3.1</a>.  It may
      be used when processing other SIDs that are not defined in this
      document.  The allocation and use of tag is outside the scope of
      this document.

   Segment List[0..n]:  128-bit IPv6 addresses representing the nth
      segment in the Segment List.  The Segment List is encoded starting
      from the last segment of the SR Policy.  That is, the first
      element of the Segment List (Segment List[0]) contains the last
      segment of the SR Policy, the second element contains the
      penultimate segment of the SR Policy, and so on.

   TLV:  Type Length Value (TLV) is described in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>.

   In the SRH, the Next Header, Hdr Ext Len, Routing Type, and Segments
   Left fields are defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8200#section-4.4">Section&nbsp;4.4 of [RFC8200]</a>.  Based on the
   constraints in that section, Next Header, Header Ext Len, and Routing
   Type are not mutable while Segments Left is mutable.

   The mutability of the TLV value is defined by the most significant
   bit in the type, as specified in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>.

   <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a> defines the mutability of the remaining fields in the SRH
   (Flags, Tag, Segment List) in the context of the SID defined in this
   document.

   New SIDs defined in the future MUST specify the mutability properties
   of the Flags, Tag, and Segment List and indicate how the Hashed
   Message Authentication Code (HMAC) TLV (<a href="#section-2.1.2">Section 2.1.2</a>) verification
   works.  Note that, in effect, these fields are mutable.

   Consistent with the SR model, the source of the SRH always knows how
   to set the Segment List, Flags, Tag, and TLVs of the SRH for use
   within the SR domain.  How it achieves this is outside the scope of
   this document but may be based on topology, available SIDs and their
   mutability properties, the SRH mutability requirements of the
   destination, or any other information.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  SRH TLVs</span>

   This section defines TLVs of the Segment Routing Header.

   A TLV provides metadata for segment processing.  The only TLVs
   defined in this document are the HMAC (<a href="#section-2.1.2">Section 2.1.2</a>) and padding
   TLVs (<a href="#section-2.1.1">Section 2.1.1</a>).  While processing the SID defined in
   <a href="#section-4.3.1">Section 4.3.1</a>, all TLVs are ignored unless local configuration
   indicates otherwise (<a href="#section-4.3.1.1.1">Section 4.3.1.1.1</a>).  Thus, TLV and HMAC support
   is optional for any implementation; however, an implementation adding
   or parsing TLVs MUST support PAD TLVs.  Other documents may define
   additional TLVs and processing rules for them.

   TLVs are present when the Hdr Ext Len is greater than (Last
   Entry+1)*2.

   While processing TLVs at a segment endpoint, TLVs MUST be fully
   contained within the SRH as determined by the Hdr Ext Len.  Detection
   of TLVs exceeding the boundary of the SRH Hdr Ext Len results in an
   ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message to the Source Address,
   pointing to the Hdr Ext Len field of the SRH, and the packet being
   discarded.

   An implementation MAY limit the number and/or length of TLVs it
   processes based on local configuration.  It MAY limit:

   *  the number of consecutive Pad1 (<a href="#section-2.1.1.1">Section 2.1.1.1</a>) options to 1.  If
      padding of more than one byte is required, then PadN
      (<a href="#section-2.1.1.2">Section 2.1.1.2</a>) should be used.

   *  The length in PadN to 5.

   *  The maximum number of non-Pad TLVs to be processed.

   *  The maximum length of all TLVs to be processed.

   The implementation MAY stop processing additional TLVs in the SRH
   when these configured limits are exceeded.

   |     Type      |    Length     | Variable-length data
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-----------------------

   Type:  An 8-bit codepoint from the &quot;Segment Routing Header TLVs&quot;
      [<a href="#ref-IANA-SRHTLV">IANA-SRHTLV</a>].  Unrecognized Types MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Length:  The length of the variable-length data field in bytes.

   Variable-length data:  data that is specific to the Type.

   Type Length Value (TLV) entries contain OPTIONAL information that may
   be used by the node identified in the Destination Address (DA) of the
   packet.

   Each TLV has its own length, format, and semantic.  The codepoint
   allocated (by IANA) to each TLV Type defines both the format and the
   semantic of the information carried in the TLV.  Multiple TLVs may be
   encoded in the same SRH.

   The highest-order bit of the TLV type (bit 0) specifies whether or
   not the TLV data of that type can change en route to the packet&#x27;s
   final destination:

      0: TLV data does not change en route

      1: TLV data does change en route

   All TLVs specify their alignment requirements using an xn+y format.
   The xn+y format is defined as per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8200" title="&quot;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification&quot;">RFC8200</a>].  The SR source nodes use
   the xn+y alignment requirements of TLVs and Padding TLVs when
   constructing an SRH.

   The Length field of the TLV is used to skip the TLV while inspecting
   the SRH in case the node doesn&#x27;t support or recognize the Type.  The
   Length defines the TLV length in octets, not including the Type and
   Length fields.

   The following TLVs are defined in this document:

      Padding TLVs

      HMAC TLV

   Additional TLVs may be defined in the future.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1.1" href="#section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>.  Padding TLVs</span>

   There are two types of Padding TLVs, Pad1 and PadN, and the following
   applies to both:

      Padding TLVs are used for meeting the alignment requirement of the
      subsequent TLVs.

      Padding TLVs are used to pad the SRH to a multiple of 8 octets.

      Padding TLVs are ignored by a node processing the SRH TLV.

      Multiple Padding TLVs MAY be used in one SRH.

   where:

   Type:  5.

   Length:  The length of the variable-length data in bytes.

   D:  1 bit. 1 indicates that the Destination Address verification is
      disabled due to use of a reduced Segment List (see <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>).

   RESERVED:  15 bits.  MUST be 0 on transmission.

   HMAC Key ID:  A 4-octet opaque number that uniquely identifies the
      pre-shared key and algorithm used to generate the HMAC.

   HMAC:  Keyed HMAC, in multiples of 8 octets, at most 32 octets.

   The HMAC TLV is used to verify that the SRH applied to a packet was
   selected by an authorized party and to ensure that the segment list
   is not modified after generation.  This also allows for verification
   that the current segment (by virtue of being in the authorized
   Segment List) is authorized for use.  The SR domain ensures that the
   source node is permitted to use the source address in the packet via
   ingress filtering mechanisms as defined in <a href="/doc/html/bcp84">BCP 84</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3704" title="&quot;Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks&quot;">RFC3704</a>] or other
   strategies as appropriate.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1.2.1" href="#section-2.1.2.1">2.1.2.1</a>.  HMAC Generation and Verification</span>

   Local configuration determines when to check for an HMAC.  This local
   configuration is outside the scope of this document.  It may be based
   on the active segment at an SR Segment endpoint node, the result of
   an Access Control List (ACL) that considers incoming interface, HMAC
   Key ID, or other packet fields.

   An implementation that supports the generation and verification of
   the HMAC supports the following default behavior, as defined in the
   remainder of this section.

   The HMAC verification begins by checking that the current segment is
   equal to the destination address of the IPv6 header.  The check is
   successful when either:

   *  HMAC D bit is 1 and Segments Left is greater than Last Entry, or

   *  HMAC Segments Left is less than or equal to Last Entry, and the
      destination address is equal to Segment List[Segments Left].

   The HMAC field is the output of the HMAC computation as defined in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2104" title="&quot;HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication&quot;">RFC2104</a>], using:

   *  key: The pre-shared key identified by HMAC Key ID

   *  HMAC algorithm: Identified by the HMAC Key ID

   *  Text: A concatenation of the following fields from the IPv6 header
      and the SRH, as it would be received at the node verifying the
      HMAC:

      -  IPv6 header: Source address (16 octets)

      -  SRH: Last Entry (1 octet)

      -  SRH: Flags (1 octet)

      -  SRH: HMAC 16 bits following Length

      -  SRH: HMAC Key ID (4 octets)

      -  SRH: All addresses in the Segment List (variable octets)

   The HMAC digest is truncated to 32 octets and placed in the HMAC
   field of the HMAC TLV.

   For HMAC algorithms producing digests less than 32 octets long, the
   digest is placed in the lowest-order octets of the HMAC field.
   Subsequent octets MUST be set to zero such that the HMAC length is a
   multiple of 8 octets.

   If HMAC verification is successful, processing proceeds as normal.

   If HMAC verification fails, an ICMP error message (parameter problem,
   error code 0, pointing to the HMAC TLV) SHOULD be generated (but rate
   limited) and logged, and the packet SHOULD be discarded.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1.2.2" href="#section-2.1.2.2">2.1.2.2</a>.  HMAC Pre-shared Key Algorithm</span>

   The HMAC Key ID field allows for the simultaneous existence of
   several hash algorithms (SHA-256, SHA3-256 ... or future ones) as
   well as pre-shared keys.

   The HMAC Key ID field is opaque -- i.e., it has neither syntax nor
   semantic except as an identifier of the right combination of pre-
   shared key and hash algorithm.

   At the HMAC TLV generating and verification nodes, the Key ID
   uniquely identifies the pre-shared key and HMAC algorithm.

   At the HMAC TLV generating node, the Text for the HMAC computation is
   set to the IPv6 header fields and SRH fields as they would appear at
   the verification node(s), not necessarily the same as the source node
   sending a packet with the HMAC TLV.

   Pre-Shared key rollover is supported by having two key IDs in use
   while the HMAC TLV generating node and verifying node converge to a
   new key.

   The HMAC TLV generating node may need to revoke an SRH for which it
   previously generated an HMAC.  Revocation is achieved by allocating a
   new key and key ID, then rolling over the key ID associated with the
   SRH to be revoked.  The HMAC TLV verifying node drops packets with
   the revoked SRH.

   An implementation supporting HMAC can support multiple hash
   functions.  An implementation supporting HMAC MUST implement SHA-2
   [<a href="#ref-FIPS180-4">FIPS180-4</a>] in its SHA-256 variant.

   The selection of pre-shared key and algorithm and their distribution
   is outside the scope of this document.  Some options may include:

   *  setting these items in the configuration of the HMAC generating or
      verifying nodes, either by static configuration or any SDN-
      oriented approach

   *  dynamically using a trusted key distribution protocol such as
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6407" title="&quot;The Group Domain of Interpretation&quot;">RFC6407</a>]

   While key management is outside the scope of this document, the
   recommendations of <a href="/doc/html/bcp107">BCP 107</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4107" title="&quot;Guidelines for Cryptographic Key Management&quot;">RFC4107</a>] should be considered when
   choosing the key management system.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  SR Nodes</span>

   There are different types of nodes that may be involved in segment
   routing networks: SR source nodes that originate packets with a
   segment in the destination address of the IPv6 header, transit nodes
   that forward packets destined to a remote segment, and SR segment
   endpoint nodes that process a local segment in the destination
   address of an IPv6 header.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  SR Source Node</span>

   A SR source node is any node that originates an IPv6 packet with a
   segment (i.e., SRv6 SID) in the destination address of the IPv6
   header.  The packet leaving the SR source node may or may not contain
   an SRH.  This includes either:

   *  A host originating an IPv6 packet, or

   *  An SR domain ingress router encapsulating a received packet in an
      outer IPv6 header, followed by an optional SRH.

   It is out of the scope of this document to describe the mechanism
   through which a segment in the destination address of the IPv6 header
   and the Segment List in the SRH are derived.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Transit Node</span>

   A transit node is any node forwarding an IPv6 packet where the
   destination address of that packet is not locally configured as a
   segment or a local interface.  A transit node is not required to be
   capable of processing a segment or SRH.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  SR Segment Endpoint Node</span>

   An SR segment endpoint node is any node receiving an IPv6 packet
   where the destination address of that packet is locally configured as
   a segment or local interface.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Packet Processing</span>

   This section describes SRv6 packet processing at the SR source,
   Transit, and SR segment endpoint nodes.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  SR Source Node</span>

   A source node steers a packet into an SR Policy.  If the SR Policy
   results in a Segment List containing a single segment, and there is
   no need to add information to the SRH flag or add TLV; the DA is set
   to the single Segment List entry, and the SRH MAY be omitted.

   When needed, the SRH is created as follows:

      The Next Header and Hdr Ext Len fields are set as specified in
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8200" title="&quot;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification&quot;">RFC8200</a>].

      The Routing Type field is set to 4.

      The DA of the packet is set with the value of the first segment.

      The first element of the SRH Segment List is the ultimate segment.
      The second element is the penultimate segment, and so on.

      The Segments Left field is set to n-1, where n is the number of
      elements in the SR Policy.

      The Last Entry field is set to n-1, where n is the number of
      elements in the SR Policy.

      TLVs (including HMAC) may be set according to their specification.

      The packet is forwarded toward the packet&#x27;s Destination Address
      (the first segment).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Reduced SRH</span>

   When a source does not require the entire SID list to be preserved in
   the SRH, a reduced SRH may be used.

   A reduced SRH does not contain the first segment of the related SR
   Policy (the first segment is the one already in the DA of the IPv6
   header), and the Last Entry field is set to n-2, where n is the
   number of elements in the SR Policy.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Transit Node</span>

   As specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8200" title="&quot;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification&quot;">RFC8200</a>], the only node allowed to inspect the
   Routing Extension Header (and therefore the SRH) is the node
   corresponding to the DA of the packet.  Any other transit node MUST
   NOT inspect the underneath routing header and MUST forward the packet
   toward the DA according to its IPv6 routing table.

   When a SID is in the destination address of an IPv6 header of a
   packet, it&#x27;s routed through an IPv6 network as an IPv6 address.
   SIDs, or the prefix(es) covering SIDs, and their reachability may be
   distributed by means outside the scope of this document.  For
   example, [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5308" title="&quot;Routing IPv6 with IS-IS&quot;">RFC5308</a>] or [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5340" title="&quot;OSPF for IPv6&quot;">RFC5340</a>] may be used to advertise a prefix
   covering the SIDs on a node.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  SR Segment Endpoint Node</span>

   Without constraining the details of an implementation, the SR segment
   endpoint node creates Forwarding Information Base (FIB) entries for
   its local SIDs.

   When an SRv6-capable node receives an IPv6 packet, it performs a
   longest-prefix-match lookup on the packet&#x27;s destination address.
   This lookup can return any of the following:

   *  A FIB entry that represents a locally instantiated SRv6 SID

   *  A FIB entry that represents a local interface, not locally
      instantiated as an SRv6 SID

   *  A FIB entry that represents a nonlocal route

   *  No Match

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3.1" href="#section-4.3.1">4.3.1</a>.  FIB Entry Is a Locally Instantiated SRv6 SID</span>

   This document and section define a single SRv6 SID.  Future documents
   may define additional SRv6 SIDs.  In such a case, the entire content
   of this section will be defined in that document.

   If the FIB entry represents a locally instantiated SRv6 SID, process
   the next header chain of the IPv6 header as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8200#section-4">Section&nbsp;4 of
   [RFC8200]</a>.  <a href="#section-4.3.1.1">Section 4.3.1.1</a> describes how to process an SRH;
   <a href="#section-4.3.1.2">Section 4.3.1.2</a> describes how to process an upper-layer header or the
   absence of a Next Header.

   Processing this SID modifies the Segments Left and, if configured to
   process TLVs, it may modify the &quot;variable-length data&quot; of TLV types
   that change en route.  Therefore, Segments Left is mutable, and TLVs
   that change en route are mutable.  The remainder of the SRH (Flags,
   Tag, Segment List, and TLVs that do not change en route) are
   immutable while processing this SID.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3.1.1.1" href="#section-4.3.1.1.1">4.3.1.1.1</a>.  TLV Processing</span>

   Local configuration determines how TLVs are to be processed when the
   Active Segment is a local SID defined in this document.  The
   definition of local configuration is outside the scope of this
   document.

   For illustration purposes only, two example local configurations that
   may be associated with a SID are provided below.

   Example 1:
   For any packet received from interface I2
     Skip TLV processing

   Example 2:
   For any packet received from interface I1
     If first TLV is HMAC {
       Process the HMAC TLV
     }
     Else {
       Discard the packet
     }

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3.1.2" href="#section-4.3.1.2">4.3.1.2</a>.  Upper-Layer Header or No Next Header</span>

   When processing the upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an SRv6 SID defined in this document:

   IF (Upper-layer Header is IPv4 or IPv6) and
       local configuration permits {
     Perform IPv6 decapsulation
     Resubmit the decapsulated packet to the IPv4 or IPv6 module

     discard the packet.  Error code (4) &quot;SR Upper-layer
     Header Error&quot;, pointer set to the offset of the upper-layer
     header.
   }

   A unique error code allows an SR source node to recognize an error in
   SID processing at an endpoint.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3.2" href="#section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>.  FIB Entry Is a Local Interface</span>

   If the FIB entry represents a local interface and is not locally
   instantiated as an SRv6 SID, the SRH is processed as follows:

      If Segments Left is zero, the node must ignore the routing header
      and proceed to process the next header in the packet, whose type
      is identified by the Next Header field in the routing header.

      If Segments Left is non-zero, the node must discard the packet and
      send an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message to the packet&#x27;s
      Source Address, pointing to the unrecognized Routing Type.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Intra-SR-Domain Deployment Model</span>

   The use of the SIDs exclusively within the SR domain and solely for
   packets of the SR domain is an important deployment model.

   This enables the SR domain to act as a single routing system.

   This section covers:

   *  securing the SR domain from external attempts to use its SIDs

   *  using the SR domain as a single system with delegation between
      components

   *  handling packets of the SR domain

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Securing the SR Domain</span>

   Nodes outside the SR domain are not trusted: they cannot directly use
   the SIDs of the domain.  This is enforced by two levels of access
   control lists:

   1.  Any packet entering the SR domain and destined to a SID within
       the SR domain is dropped.  This may be realized with the
       following logic.  Other methods with equivalent outcome are
       considered compliant:

       *  Allocate all the SIDs from a block S/s

       *  Configure each external interface of each edge node of the
          domain with an inbound infrastructure access list (IACL) that
          drops any incoming packet with a destination address in S/s

       *  Failure to implement this method of ingress filtering exposes
          the SR domain to source-routing attacks, as described and
          referenced in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5095" title="&quot;Deprecation of Type 0 Routing Headers in IPv6&quot;">RFC5095</a>]

   2.  The distributed protection in #1 is complemented with per-node
       protection, dropping packets to SIDs from source addresses
       outside the SR domain.  This may be realized with the following
       logic.  Other methods with equivalent outcome are considered
       compliant:

       *  Assign all interface addresses from prefix A/a

       *  At node k, all SIDs local to k are assigned from prefix Sk/sk

       *  Configure each internal interface of each SR node k in the SR
          domain with an inbound IACL that drops any incoming packet
          with a destination address in Sk/sk if the source address is
          not in A/a.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  SR Domain as a Single System with Delegation among Components</span>

   All intra-SR-domain packets are of the SR domain.  The IPv6 header is
   originated by a node of the SR domain and is destined to a node of
   the SR domain.

   All interdomain packets are encapsulated for the part of the packet
   journey that is within the SR domain.  The outer IPv6 header is
   originated by a node of the SR domain and is destined to a node of
   the SR domain.

   As a consequence, any packet within the SR domain is of the SR
   domain.

   The SR domain is a system in which the operator may want to
   distribute or delegate different operations of the outermost header
   to different nodes within the system.

   An operator of an SR domain may choose to delegate SRH addition to a
   host node within the SR domain and delegate validation of the
   contents of any SRH to a more trusted router or switch attached to
   the host.  Consider a top-of-rack switch T connected to host H via
   interface I.  H receives an SRH (SRH1) with a computed HMAC via some
   SDN method outside the scope of this document.  H classifies traffic
   it sources and adds SRH1 to traffic requiring a specific Service
   Level Agreement (SLA).  T is configured with an IACL on I requiring
   verification of the SRH for any packet destined to the SID block of
   the SR domain (S/s).  T checks and verifies that SRH1 is valid and
   contains an HMAC TLV; T then verifies the HMAC.

   An operator of the SR domain may choose to have all segments in the
   SR domain verify the HMAC.  This mechanism would verify that the SRH
   Segment List is not modified while traversing the SR domain.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  MTU Considerations</span>

   An SR domain ingress edge node encapsulates packets traversing the SR
   domain and needs to consider the MTU of the SR domain.  Within the SR
   domain, well-known mitigation techniques are RECOMMENDED, such as
   deploying a greater MTU value within the SR domain than at the
   ingress edges.

   Encapsulation with an outer IPv6 header and SRH shares the same MTU
   and fragmentation considerations as IPv6 tunnels described in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2473" title="&quot;Generic Packet Tunneling in IPv6 Specification&quot;">RFC2473</a>].  Further investigation on the limitation of various
   tunneling methods (including IPv6 tunnels) is discussed in
   [<a href="#ref-INTAREA-TUNNELS">INTAREA-TUNNELS</a>] and SHOULD be considered by operators when
   considering MTU within the SR domain.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.4" href="#section-5.4">5.4</a>.  ICMP Error Processing</span>

   ICMP error packets generated within the SR domain are sent to source
   nodes within the SR domain.  The invoking packet in the ICMP error
   message may contain an SRH.  Since the destination address of a
   packet with an SRH changes as each segment is processed, it may not
   be the destination used by the socket or application that generated
   the invoking packet.

   For the source of an invoking packet to process the ICMP error
   message, the ultimate destination address of the IPv6 header may be
   required.  The following logic is used to determine the destination
   address for use by protocol-error handlers.

   *  Walk all extension headers of the invoking IPv6 packet to the
      routing extension header preceding the upper-layer header.

      -  If routing header is type 4 Segment Routing Header (SRH)

         o  The SID at Segment List[0] may be used as the destination
            address of the invoking packet.

   ICMP errors are then processed by upper-layer transports as defined
   in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4443" title="&quot;Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification&quot;">RFC4443</a>].

   For IP packets encapsulated in an outer IPv6 header, ICMP error
   handling is as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2473" title="&quot;Generic Packet Tunneling in IPv6 Specification&quot;">RFC2473</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.5" href="#section-5.5">5.5</a>.  Load Balancing and ECMP</span>

   For any interdomain packet, the SR source node MUST impose a flow
   label computed based on the inner packet.  The computation of the
   flow label is as recommended in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6438" title="&quot;Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Equal Cost Multipath Routing and Link Aggregation in Tunnels&quot;">RFC6438</a>] for the sending Tunnel End
   Point.

   For any intradomain packet, the SR source node SHOULD impose a flow
   label computed as described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6437" title="&quot;IPv6 Flow Label Specification&quot;">RFC6437</a>] to assist ECMP load
   balancing at transit nodes incapable of computing a 5-tuple beyond
   the SRH.

   At any transit node within an SR domain, the flow label MUST be used
   as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6438" title="&quot;Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Equal Cost Multipath Routing and Link Aggregation in Tunnels&quot;">RFC6438</a>] to calculate the ECMP hash toward the
   destination address.  If a flow label is not used, the transit node
   would likely hash all packets between a pair of SR Edge nodes to the
   same link.

   At an SR segment endpoint node, the flow label MUST be used as
   defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6438" title="&quot;Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Equal Cost Multipath Routing and Link Aggregation in Tunnels&quot;">RFC6438</a>] to calculate any ECMP hash used to forward the
   processed packet to the next segment.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Illustrations</span>

   This section provides illustrations of SRv6 packet processing at SR
   source, transit, and SR segment endpoint nodes.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Abstract Representation of an SRH</span>

   For a node k, its IPv6 address is represented as Ak, and its SRv6 SID
   is represented as Sk.

   IPv6 headers are represented as the tuple of (source,destination).
   For example, a packet with source address A1 and destination address
   A2 is represented as (A1,A2).  The payload of the packet is omitted.

   An SR Policy is a list of segments.  A list of segments is
   represented as &lt;S1,S2,S3&gt; where S1 is the first SID to visit, S2 is
   the second SID to visit, and S3 is the last SID to visit.

   (SA,DA) (S3,S2,S1; SL) represents an IPv6 packet with:

   *  Source Address SA, Destination Addresses DA, and next header SRH.

   *  SRH with SID list &lt;S1,S2,S3&gt; with SegmentsLeft = SL.

   *  Note the difference between the &lt;&gt; and () symbols.  &lt;S1,S2,S3&gt;
      represents a SID list where the leftmost segment is the first
      segment.  In contrast, (S3,S2,S1; SL) represents the same SID list
      but encoded in the SRH Segment List format where the leftmost
      segment is the last segment.  When referring to an SR Policy in a
      high-level use case, it is simpler to use the &lt;S1,S2,S3&gt; notation.
      When referring to an illustration of detailed behavior, the
      (S3,S2,S1; SL) notation is more convenient.

   At its SR Policy headend, the Segment List &lt;S1,S2,S3&gt; results in SRH
   (S3,S2,S1; SL=2) represented fully as:

       Segments Left=2
       Last Entry=2
       Flags=0
       Tag=0
       Segment List[0]=S3
       Segment List[1]=S2

   In the opposite direction, the packet generated from 1 to 8 is

   P8: (A1,A8)

   At node 3, P8 is encapsulated for the portion of its journey within
   the SR domain, with the outer header destined to segment S8.  This
   results in

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.6.1" href="#section-6.6.1">6.6.1</a>.  SID List Verification</span>

   An operator may prefer to apply the SRH at source 8, while 5 verifies
   that the SID list is valid.

   For illustration purposes, an SDN controller provides 8 an SRH
   terminating at node 9, with Segment List &lt;S5,S7,S6,A9&gt;, and HMAC TLV
   computed for the SRH.  The HMAC key ID and key associated with the
   HMAC TLV is shared with 5.  Node 8 does not know the key.  Node 5 is
   configured with an IACL applied to the interface connected to 8,
   requiring HMAC verification for any packet destined to S/s.

   Node 8 originates packets with the received SRH, including HMAC TLV.

   P15: (A8,S5)(A9,S6,S7,S5;SL=3;HMAC)

   Node 5 receives and verifies the HMAC for the SRH, then forwards the
   packet to the next segment

   P16: (A8,S7)(A9,S6,S7,S5;SL=2;HMAC)

   Node 6 receives

   P17: (A8,S6)(A9,S6,S7,S5;SL=1;HMAC)

   Node 9 receives

   P18: (A8,A9)(A9,S6,S7,S5;SL=0;HMAC)

   This use of an HMAC is particularly valuable within an enterprise-
   based SR domain [<a href="#ref-SRN" title="&quot;Software Resolved Networks: Rethinking Enterprise Networks with IPv6 Segment Routing&quot;">SRN</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This section reviews security considerations related to the SRH,
   given the SRH processing and deployment models discussed in this
   document.

   As described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>, it is necessary to filter packets&#x27; ingress
   to the SR domain, destined to SIDs within the SR domain (i.e.,
   bearing a SID in the destination address).  This ingress filtering is
   via an IACL at SR domain ingress border nodes.  Additional protection
   is applied via an IACL at each SR Segment Endpoint node, filtering
   packets not from within the SR domain, destined to SIDs in the SR
   domain.  ACLs are easily supported for small numbers of seldom
   changing prefixes, making summarization important.

   Additionally, ingress filtering of IPv6 source addresses as
   recommended in <a href="/doc/html/bcp38">BCP 38</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2827" title="&quot;Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing&quot;">RFC2827</a>] SHOULD be used.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  SR Attacks</span>

   An SR domain implements distributed and per-node protection as
   described in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.  Additionally, domains deny traffic with
   spoofed addresses by implementing the recommendations in <a href="/doc/html/bcp84">BCP 84</a>
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3704" title="&quot;Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks&quot;">RFC3704</a>].

   Full implementation of the recommended protection blocks the attacks
   documented in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5095" title="&quot;Deprecation of Type 0 Routing Headers in IPv6&quot;">RFC5095</a>] from outside the SR domain, including
   bypassing filtering devices, reaching otherwise-unreachable Internet
   systems, network topology discovery, bandwidth exhaustion, and
   defeating anycast.

   Failure to implement distributed and per-node protection allows
   attackers to bypass filtering devices and exposes the SR domain to
   these attacks.

   Compromised nodes within the SR domain may mount the attacks listed
   above along with other known attacks on IP networks (e.g., DoS/DDoS,
   topology discovery, man-in-the-middle, traffic interception/
   siphoning).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Service Theft</span>

   Service theft is defined as the use of a service offered by the SR
   domain by a node not authorized to use the service.

   Service theft is not a concern within the SR domain, as all SR source
   nodes and SR segment endpoint nodes within the domain are able to
   utilize the services of the domain.  If a node outside the SR domain
   learns of segments or a topological service within the SR domain,
   IACL filtering denies access to those segments.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.3" href="#section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Topology Disclosure</span>

   The SRH is unencrypted and may contain SIDs of some intermediate SR
   nodes in the path towards the destination within the SR domain.  If
   packets can be snooped within the SR domain, the SRH may reveal
   topology, traffic flows, and service usage.

   This is applicable within an SR domain, but the disclosure is less
   relevant as an attacker has other means of learning topology, flows,
   and service usage.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.4" href="#section-7.4">7.4</a>.  ICMP Generation</span>

   The generation of ICMPv6 error messages may be used to attempt
   denial-of-service attacks by sending an error-causing destination
   address or SRH in back-to-back packets.  An implementation that
   correctly follows <a href="/doc/html/rfc4443#section-2.4">Section&nbsp;2.4 of [RFC4443]</a> would be protected by the
   ICMPv6 rate-limiting mechanism.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.5" href="#section-7.5">7.5</a>.  Applicability of AH</span>

   The SR domain is a trusted domain, as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8402" title="&quot;Segment Routing Architecture&quot;">RFC8402</a>], Sections
   2 and 8.2.  The SR source is trusted to add an SRH (optionally
   verified as having been generated by a trusted source via the HMAC
   TLV in this document), and segments advertised within the domain are
   trusted to be accurate and advertised by trusted sources via a secure
   control plane.  As such, the SR domain does not rely on the
   Authentication Header (AH) as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4302" title="&quot;IP Authentication Header&quot;">RFC4302</a>] to secure the SRH.

   The use of SRH with AH by an SR source node and its processing at an
   SR segment endpoint node are not defined in this document.  Future
   documents may define use of SRH with AH and its processing.
