Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) and issues related to its deployment.
   It discusses how the SSM service model addresses the challenges faced
   in inter-domain multicast deployment, changes needed to routing
   protocols and applications to deploy SSM and interoperability issues
   with current multicast service models.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document provides an overview of the Source-Specific Multicast
   (SSM) service and its deployment using the PIM-SM and IGMP/MLD
   protocols.  The network layer service provided by SSM is a &quot;channel&quot;,
   identified by an SSM destination IP address (G) and a source IP
   address S.  An IPv4 address range has been reserved by IANA for use
   by the SSM service.  An SSM destination address range already exists
   for IPv6.  A source S transmits IP datagrams to an SSM destination
   address G.  A receiver can receive these datagrams by subscribing to
   the channel (Source, Group) or (S,G).  Channel subscription is
   supported by version 3 of the IGMP protocol for IPv4 and version2 of
   the MLD protocol for IPv6.  The interdomain tree for forwarding IP
   multicast datagrams is rooted at the source S, and is constructed
   using the PIM Sparse Mode [<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">9</a>] protocol.

   This document is not intended to be a standard for Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM).  Instead, its goal is to serve as an introduction to
   SSM and its benefits for anyone interested in deploying SSM services.
   It provides an overview of SSM and how it solves a number of problems
   faced in the deployment of inter-domain multicast.  It outlines
   changes to protocols and applications both at end-hosts and routers

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   This section defines some terms that are used in the rest of this
   document:

      Any-Source Multicast (ASM): This is the IP multicast service model
      defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1112">RFC 1112</a> [<a href="#ref-25" title="&quot;Host Extensions for IP Multicasting&quot;">25</a>].  An IP datagram is transmitted to a
      &quot;host group&quot;, a set of zero or more end-hosts (or routers)
      identified by a single IP destination address (224.0.0.0 through
      239.255.255.255 for IPv4).  End-hosts may join and leave the group
      any time, and there is no restriction on their location or number.
      Moreover, this model supports multicast groups with arbitrarily
      many senders - any end-host (or router) may transmit to a host
      group, even if it is not a member of that group.

      Source-Specific Multicast (SSM): This is the multicast service
      model defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Source-Specific Multicast for IP&quot;">5</a>].  An IP datagram is transmitted by a source S
      to an SSM destination address G, and receivers can receive this
      datagram by subscribing to channel (S,G).  SSM provides host
      applications with a &quot;channel&quot; abstraction, in which each channel
      has exactly one source and any number of receivers.  SSM is
      derived from earlier work in EXPRESS [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;IP Multicast Channels: EXPRESS Support for Large-scale Single-Source Applications&quot;">1</a>].  The address range 232/8
      has been assigned by IANA for SSM service in IPv4.  For IPv6, the
      range FF3x::/96 is defined for SSM services [<a href="#ref-21" title="&quot;Unicast-Prefix-Based IPv6 Multicast Addresses&quot;">21</a>].

      Source-Filtered Multicast (SFM): This is a variant of the ASM
      service model, and uses the same address range as ASM
      (224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255).  It extends the ASM service model as
      follows.  Each &quot;upper layer protocol module&quot; can now request data
      sent to a host group G by only a specific set of sources, or can
      request data sent to host group G from all BUT a specific set of
      sources.  Support for source filtering is provided by version 3 of
      the Internet Group Management Protocol (or IGMPv3) [<a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3.&quot;">3</a>] for IPv4,
      and version 2 of the Multicast Listener Discovery (or MLDv2) [<a href="#ref-22" title="&quot;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol&quot;">22</a>]
      protocol for IPv6.  We shall henceforth refer to these two
      protocols as &quot;SFM-capable&quot;.  Earlier versions of these
      protocols - IGMPv1/IGMPv2 and MLDv1 - do not provide support for



<span class="grey">Bhattacharyya                Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc3569">RFC 3569</a>                   An Overview of SSM                  July 2003</span>


      source-filtering, and are referred to as &quot;non-SFM-capable&quot;.  Note
      that while SFM is a different model than ASM from a receiver
      standpoint, there is no distinction between the two for a sender.

   For the purpose of this document, we treat the scoped multicast model
   of [<a href="#ref-12" title="&quot;Adminstratively Scoped IP Multicast&quot;">12</a>] to be a variant of ASM since it does not explicitly restrict
   the number of sources, but only requires that they be located within
   the scope zone of the group.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  The IGMP/PIM-SM/MSDP/MBGP Protocol Suite for ASM</span>

   As of this writing, all multicast-capable networks support the ASM
   service model.  One of the most common multicast protocol suites for
   supporting ASM consists of IGMP version 2 [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2&quot;">2</a>], PIM-SM [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification&quot;">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">9</a>], MSDP
   [<a href="#ref-13" title="&quot;Multicast Source Discovery Protocol&quot;">13</a>] and MBGP [<a href="#ref-26" title="&quot;Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4&quot;">26</a>].  IGMPv2 is the most commonly used protocol for
   hosts to specify membership in a multicast group, and nearly all
   multicast routers support (at least) IGMPv2.  In case of IPv6, MLDv1
   [<a href="#ref-21" title="&quot;Unicast-Prefix-Based IPv6 Multicast Addresses&quot;">21</a>] is the commonly used protocol.

   Although a number of protocols such as PIM-DM [<a href="#ref-10" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Dense Mode (PIM-DM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">10</a>], CBT [<a href="#ref-24" title="&quot;Core-Based Trees (CBT Version 2) Multicast Routing -- Protocol Specification&quot;">24</a>,<a href="#ref-11" title="&quot;Core-Based Trees (CBT) Multicast Routing Architecture&quot;">11</a>],
   DVMRP [<a href="#ref-6" title="&quot;Multicast Routing in Datagram Networks and Extended LANs&quot;">6</a>], etc. exist for building multicast tree among all receivers
   and sources in the same administrative domain, PIM-SM [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification&quot;">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">9</a>] is the
   most widely used protocol.  PIM-SM builds a spanning multicast tree
   rooted at a core rendezvous point or RP for all group members within
   a single administrative domain.  A &#x27;first-hop&#x27; router adjacent to a
   multicast source sends the source&#x27;s traffic to the RP for its domain.
   The RP forwards the data down the shared spanning tree to all
   interested receivers within the domain.  PIM-SM also allows receivers
   to switch to a source-based shortest path tree.

   As of this writing, multicast end-hosts with SFM capabilities are not
   widely available.  Hence a client can only specify interest in an
   entire host group and receives data sent from any source to this
   group.

   Inter-domain multicast service (i.e., where sources and receivers are
   located in different domains) requires additional protocols - MSDP
   [<a href="#ref-13" title="&quot;Multicast Source Discovery Protocol&quot;">13</a>] and MBGP [<a href="#ref-26" title="&quot;Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4&quot;">26</a>] are the most commonly used ones.  An RP uses the
   MSDP protocol to announce multicast sources to RPs in other domains.
   When an RP discovers a source in a different domain transmitting data
   to a multicast group for which there are interested receivers in its
   own domain, it joins the shortest-path source based tree rooted at
   that source.  It then redistributes the data received to all
   interested receivers via the intra-domain shared tree rooted at
   itself.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc3569">RFC 3569</a>                   An Overview of SSM                  July 2003</span>


   MBGP defines extensions to the BGP protocol to support the
   advertisement of reachability information for multicast routes.  This
   allows an autonomous system (AS) to support incongruent unicast and
   multicast routing topologies, and thus implement separate routing
   policies for each.

   However, the last-hop routers of interested receivers may eventually
   switch to a shortest-path tree rooted at the source that is
   transmitting the data.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Problems with Current Architecture</span>

   There are several deployment problems associated with current
   multicast architecture:

      A) Address Allocation:

         Address allocation is one of core deployment challenges posed
         by the ASM service model.  The current multicast architecture
         does not provide a deployable solution to prevent address
         collisions among multiple applications.  The problem is much
         less serious for IPv6 than for IPv4 since the size of the
         multicast address space is much larger.  A static address
         allocation scheme, GLOP [<a href="#ref-17" title="&quot;GLOP Addressing in 233/8&quot;">17</a>] has been proposed as an interim
         solution for IPv4; however, GLOP addresses are allocated per
         registered AS, which is inadequate in cases where the number of
         sources exceeds the AS numbers available for mapping.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc3138">RFC 3138</a>
         expands on <a href="/doc/html/rfc2770">RFC 2770</a> to allow routing registries to assign
         multicast addresses from the GLOP space corresponding to the
         <a href="/doc/html/rfc1930">RFC 1930</a> private AS space [<a href="#ref-27" title="&quot;Extended Assignments in 233/8&quot;">27</a>].  This space is referred to as
         the EGLOP (Extended GLOP) address space.  Proposed longer-term
         solutions such as the Multicast Address Allocation Architecture
         [<a href="#ref-14" title="&quot;The Internet Multicast Address Allocation Architecture&quot;">14</a>] are generally perceived as being too complex (with respect
         to the dynamic nature of multicast address allocation) for
         widespread deployment.

      B) Lack of Access control:

         In the ASM service model, a receiver cannot specify which
         specific sources it would like to receive when it joins a given
         group.  A receiver will be forwarded data sent to a host group
         by any source.  Moreover, even when a source is allocated a
         multicast group address to transmit on, it has no way of
         enforcing that no other source will use the same address.  This
         is true even in the case of IPv6, where address collisions are
         less likely due to the much larger size of the address space.

      C) Inefficient handling of well-known sources:

         In cases where the address of the source is well known in
         advance of the receiver joining the group, and when the
         shortest forwarding path is the preferred forwarding mode, then
         shared tree mechanisms are not necessary.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM): Benefits and Requirements</span>

   As mentioned before, the Source Specific Multicast (SSM) service
   model defines a &quot;channel&quot; identified by an (S,G) pair, where S is a
   source address and G is an SSM destination address.  Channel
   subscriptions are described using an SFM-capable group management
   protocol such as IGMPv3 or MLDv2.  Only source-based forwarding trees
   are needed to implement this model.

   The SSM service model alleviates all of the deployment problems
   described earlier:

      A) Address Allocation: SSM defines channels on a per-source basis,
         i.e., the channel (S1,G) is distinct from the channel (S2,G),
         where S1 and S2 are source addresses, and G is an SSM
         destination address.  This averts the problem of global
         allocation of SSM destination addresses, and makes each source
         independently responsible for resolving address collisions for
         the various channels that it creates.

      B) Access Control: SSM lends itself to an elegant solution to the
         access control problem.  When a receiver subscribes to an (S,G)
         channel, it receives data sent only by the source S.  In
         contrast, any host can transmit to an ASM host group.  At the
         same time, when a sender picks a channel (S,G) to transmit on,
         it is automatically ensured that no other sender will be
         transmitting on the same channel (except in the case of
         malicious acts such as address spoofing).  This makes it much
         harder to &quot;spam&quot; an SSM channel than an ASM multicast group.

      C) Handling of well-known sources: SSM requires only
         source-based forwarding trees; this eliminates the need for a
         shared tree infrastructure.  This implies that neither the
         RP-based shared tree infrastructure of PIM-SM nor the MSDP
         protocol is required.  Thus the complexity of the multicast
         routing infrastructure for SSM is low, making it viable for
         immediate deployment.  Note that there is no difference in how
         MBGP is used for ASM and SSM.

   We now discuss the framework elements in detail:

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Address Allocation</span>

   For IPv4, the address range of 232/8 has been assigned by IANA for
   SSM.  To ensure global SSM functionality in 232/8, including in
   networks where routers run non-SFM-capable protocols, operational
   policies are being proposed [<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">9</a>] which recommend that routers should
   not send SSM traffic to parts of the network that do not have channel
   subscribers.

   Note that IGMPv3/MLDv2 does not limit (S,G) joins to only the 232/8
   range.  However, SSM service, as defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Source-Specific Multicast for IP&quot;">5</a>], is available only in
   this address range for IPv4.

   In case of IPv6, [<a href="#ref-23" title="&quot;Allocation Guidelines for IPv6 Multicast Addresses&quot;">23</a>] has defined an extension to the addressing
   architecture to allow for unicast prefix-based multicast addresses.
   See <a href="/doc/html/rfc3306">RFC 3306</a> for details.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Session Description and Channel Discovery</span>

   An SSM receiver application must know both the SSM destination
   address G and the source address S before subscribing to a channel.
   Channel discovery is the responsibility of applications.  This
   information can be made available in a number of ways, including via
   web pages, sessions announcement applications, etc.  This is similar
   to what is used for ASM applications where a multicast session needs
   to be announced so that potential subscribers can know of the
   multicast group address, encoding schemes used, etc.  In fact, the
   only additional piece of information that needs to be announced is
   the source address for the channel being advertised.  However, the
   exact mechanisms for doing this is outside the scope of this
   framework document.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.3" href="#section-6.3">6.3</a>.  SSM-Aware Applications</span>

   There are two main issues in making multicast applications
   &quot;SSM-aware&quot;:

   -  An application that wants to receive an SSM session must first
      discover the channel address in use.

   -  A receiving application must be able to specify both a source
      address and a destination address to the network layer protocol
      module on the end-host.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc3569">RFC 3569</a>                   An Overview of SSM                  July 2003</span>


      Specific API requirements are identified in [<a href="#ref-16" title="&quot;Socket Interface Extensions for Multicast Source Filters&quot;">16</a>].  [<a href="#ref-16" title="&quot;Socket Interface Extensions for Multicast Source Filters&quot;">16</a>] describes
      a recommended application programming interface for a host
      operating system to support the SFM service model.  Although it is
      intended for SFM, a subset of this interface is sufficient for
      supporting SSM.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.4" href="#section-6.4">6.4</a>.  IGMPv3/MLDv2 Host Reporting and Querier</span>

   In order to use SSM service, an end-host must be able to specify a
   channel address, consisting of a source&#x27;s unicast address and an SSM
   destination address.  IGMP version 2 [<a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3.&quot;">3</a>] and MLD version 1 [<a href="#ref-19" title="&quot;Multicast Listener Discovery for IPv6&quot;">19</a>]
   allows an end-host to specify only a destination multicast address.
   The ability to specify an SSM channel address c is provided by IGMP
   version 3 [<a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3.&quot;">3</a>] and MLD version 2 [<a href="#ref-20" title="&quot;Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2(MLDv2) for IPv6&quot;">20</a>].  These protocols support
   &quot;source filtering&quot;, i.e., the ability of an end-system to express
   interest in receiving data packets sent only by SPECIFIC sources, or
   from ALL BUT some specific sources.  In fact, IGMPv3 provides a
   superset of the capabilities required to realize the SSM service
   model.

   A detailed discussion of the use of IGMPv3 in the SSM destination
   address range is provided in [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Using IGMPv3 and MLDv2 for Source-Specific Multicast&quot;">4</a>].

   The Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol used by an IPv6
   router to discover the presence of multicast listeners on its
   directly attached links, and to discover the multicast addresses that
   are of interest to those neighboring nodes.  MLD version 1 is derived
   from IGMPv2 and does not provide the source filtering capability
   required for the SSM service model.  MLD version 2 is derived from,
   and provides the same support for source-filtering as, IGMPv3.  Thus
   IGMPv3 (or MLDv2 for IPv6) provides a host with the ability to
   request the network for an SSM channel subscription.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.5" href="#section-6.5">6.5</a>.  PIM-SSM Routing</span>

   [<a id="ref-9">9</a>] provides guidelines for how a PIM-SM implementation should handle
   source-specific host reports as required by SSM.  Earlier versions of
   the PIM protocol specifications did not describe how to do this.

   The router requirements for operation in the SSM range are detailed
   in [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Source-Specific Multicast for IP&quot;">5</a>].  These rules are primarily concerned with preventing
   ASM-style behaviour in the SSM address range.  In order to comply
   with [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Source-Specific Multicast for IP&quot;">5</a>] several changes to the PIM-SM protocol are required, as
   described in [<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">9</a>].  The most important changes in PIM-SM required for
   compliance with [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Source-Specific Multicast for IP&quot;">5</a>] are:

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc3569">RFC 3569</a>                   An Overview of SSM                  July 2003</span>


   -  When a DR receives an (S,G) join request with the address G in the
      SSM address range, it MUST initiate a (S,G) join, and NEVER a
      (*,G) join.

   -  Backbone routers (i.e., routers that do not have directly attached
      hosts) MUST NOT propagate (*,G) joins for group addresses in the
      SSM address range.

   -  Rendezvous Points (RPs) MUST NOT accept PIM Register messages or
      (*,G) Join messages in the SSM address range.

   Note that only a small subset of the full PIM-SM protocol
   functionality is needed to support the SSM service model.  This
   subset is explicitly documented in [<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">9</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Interoperability with Existing Multicast Service Models</span>

   Interoperability with ASM is one of the most important issues in
   moving to SSM deployment, since both models are expected to be used
   at least in the foreseeable future.  SSM is the ONLY service model
   for the SSM address range - the correct protocol behaviour for this
   range is specified in [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Source-Specific Multicast for IP&quot;">5</a>].  The ASM service model will be offered for
   the non-SSM address range, where receivers can issue (*,G) join
   requests to receive multicast data.  A receiver is also allowed to
   issue an (S,G) join request in the non-SSM address range; however, in
   that case there is no guarantee that it will receive service
   according to the SSM model.

   Another interoperability issue concerns the MSDP protocol, which is
   used between PIM-SM rendezvous points (RPs) to discover multicast
   sources across multiple domains.  MSDP is not needed for SSM, but is
   needed if ASM is supported.  [<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">9</a>] specifies operational
   recommendations to help ensure that MSDP does not interfere with the
   ability of a network to support the SSM service model.  Specifically,
   [<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification (Revised)&quot;">9</a>] states that RPs must not accept, originate or forward MSDP SA
   messages for the SSM address range.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   SSM does not introduce new security considerations for IP multicast.
   It can help in preventing denial-of-service attacks resulting from
   unwanted sources transmitting data to a multicast channel (S, G).
   However no guarantee is provided.
