Abstract

   This document specifies a profile of the Certificate Management over
   CMS (CMC) protocol for managing X.509 public key certificates in
   applications that use the Commercial National Security Algorithm
   (CNSA) Suite published by the United States Government.

   The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation
   of all components of US National Security Systems that manage X.509
   public key certificates over CMS.  It is also appropriate for all
   other US Government systems that process high-value information.

   The profile is made publicly available here for use by developers and
   operators of these and any other system deployments.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document specifies a profile of the Certificate Management over
   CMS (CMC) protocol to comply with the United States National Security
   Agency&#x27;s Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite [<a href="#ref-CNSA" title="&quot;Use of Public Standards for Secure Information Sharing&quot;">CNSA</a>].
   The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation
   of all components of US National Security Systems [<a href="#ref-SP80059" title="&quot;Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System&quot;">SP80059</a>].  It is
   also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process
   high-value information.  It is made publicly available for use by
   developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.

   This document does not define any new cryptographic algorithm suites;
   instead, it defines a CNSA-compliant profile of CMC.  CMC is defined
   in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5272" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)&quot;">RFC5272</a>], [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5273" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC): Transport Protocols&quot;">RFC5273</a>], and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5274" title="&quot;Certificate Management Messages over CMS (CMC): Compliance Requirements&quot;">RFC5274</a>] and is updated by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6402" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates&quot;">RFC6402</a>].
   This document profiles CMC to manage X.509 public key certificates in
   compliance with the CNSA Suite Certificate and Certificate Revocation
   List (CRL) profile [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8603" title="&quot;Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile&quot;">RFC8603</a>].  This document specifically focuses on
   defining CMC interactions for both the initial enrollment and rekey
   of CNSA Suite public key certificates between a client and a
   Certification Authority (CA).  One or more Registration Authorities
   (RAs) may act as intermediaries between the client and the CA.  This
   profile may be further tailored by specific communities to meet their
   needs.  Specific communities will also define certificate policies
   that implementations need to comply with.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology in <a href="/doc/html/rfc5272#section-2.1">[RFC5272], Section&nbsp;2.1</a> applies to this profile.

   The term &quot;certificate request&quot; is used to refer to a single PKCS #10
   or Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) structure.  All PKI
   Requests are Full PKI Requests, and all PKI Responses are Full PKI
   Responses; the respective set of terms should be interpreted
   synonymously in this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  The Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite</span>

   The National Security Agency (NSA) profiles commercial cryptographic
   algorithms and protocols as part of its mission to support secure,
   interoperable communications for US Government National Security
   Systems.  To this end, it publishes guidance both to assist with the
   US Government transition to new algorithms and to provide vendors --
   and the Internet community in general -- with information concerning
   their proper use and configuration within the scope of US Government
   National Security Systems.

   Recently, cryptographic transition plans have become overshadowed by
   the prospect of the development of a cryptographically relevant
   quantum computer.  The NSA has established the Commercial National
   Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite to provide vendors and IT users near-
   term flexibility in meeting their cybersecurity interoperability
   requirements.  The purpose behind this flexibility is to avoid having
   vendors and customers make two major transitions in a relatively
   short timeframe, as we anticipate a need to shift to quantum-
   resistant cryptography in the near future.

   The NSA is authoring a set of RFCs, including this one, to provide
   updated guidance concerning the use of certain commonly available
   commercial algorithms in IETF protocols.  These RFCs can be used in
   conjunction with other RFCs and cryptographic guidance (e.g., NIST
   Special Publications) to properly protect Internet traffic and data-
   at-rest for US Government National Security Systems.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Requirements and Assumptions</span>

   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Elliptic Curve
   Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key pairs are on the P-384 curve.  FIPS 186-4
   [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title="&quot;Digital Signature Standard (DSS)&quot;">FIPS186</a>], <a href="#appendix-B.4">Appendix B.4</a> provides useful guidance for elliptic curve
   key pair generation that SHOULD be followed by systems that conform
   to this document.

   RSA key pairs (public, private) are identified by the modulus size
   expressed in bits; RSA-3072 and RSA-4096 are computed using moduli of
   3072 bits and 4096 bits, respectively.

   RSA signature key pairs used in CNSA Suite-compliant implementations
   are either RSA-3072 or RSA-4096.  The RSA exponent e MUST satisfy
   2^(16) &lt; e &lt; 2^(256) and be odd per [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title="&quot;Digital Signature Standard (DSS)&quot;">FIPS186</a>].

   It is recognized that, while the vast majority of RSA signatures are
   currently made using the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithm, the preferred
   RSA signature scheme for new applications is RSASSA-PSS.  CNSA Suite-
   compliant X.509 certificates will be issued in accordance with
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8603" title="&quot;Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile&quot;">RFC8603</a>], and while those certificates must be signed and validated
   using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, the subject&#x27;s private key can be used to
   generate signatures of either signing scheme.  Where use of RSASSA-
   PSS is indicated in this document, the following parameters apply:

   *  The hash algorithm MUST be id-sha384 as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8017" title="&quot;PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2&quot;">RFC8017</a>];

   *  The mask generation function MUST use the algorithm identifier
      mfg1SHA384Identifier as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4055" title="&quot;Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile&quot;">RFC4055</a>];

   *  The salt length MUST be 48 octets; and

   *  The trailerField MUST have value 1.

   These parameters will not appear in a certificate and MUST be
   securely communicated with the signature, as required by <a href="/doc/html/rfc4056#section-2.2">Section&nbsp;2.2
   of [RFC4056]</a>.  Application developers are obliged to ensure that the
   chosen signature scheme is appropriate for the application and will
   be interoperable within the intended operating scope of the
   application.

   This document assumes that the required trust anchors have been
   securely provisioned to the client and, when applicable, to any RAs.

   All requirements in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5272" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)&quot;">RFC5272</a>], [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5273" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC): Transport Protocols&quot;">RFC5273</a>], [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5274" title="&quot;Certificate Management Messages over CMS (CMC): Compliance Requirements&quot;">RFC5274</a>], and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6402" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates&quot;">RFC6402</a>]
   apply, except where overridden by this profile.

   This profile was developed with the scenarios described in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>
   in mind.  However, use of this profile is not limited to just those
   scenarios.

   The term &quot;client&quot; in this profile typically refers to an end-entity.
   However, it may instead refer to a third party acting on the end-
   entity&#x27;s behalf.  The client may or may not be the entity that
   actually generates the key pair, but it does perform the CMC protocol
   interactions with the RA and/or CA.  For example, the client may be a
   token management system that communicates with a cryptographic token
   through an out-of-band secure protocol.

   This profile uses the term &quot;rekey&quot; in the same manner as CMC does
   (defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc5272#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of [RFC5272]</a>).  The profile makes no specific
   statements about the ability to do &quot;renewal&quot; operations; however, the
   statements applicable to &quot;rekey&quot; should be applied to &quot;renewal&quot; as
   well.

   This profile may be used to manage RA and/or CA certificates.  In
   that case, the RA and/or CA whose certificate is being managed is
   considered to be the end-entity.

   This profile does not discuss key establishment certification
   requests from cryptographic modules that cannot generate a one-time
   signature with a key establishment key for proof-of-possession
   purposes.  In that case, a separate profile would be needed to define
   the use of another proof-of-possession technique.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Client Requirements: Generating PKI Requests</span>

   This section specifies the conventions employed when a client
   requests a certificate from a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

   The Full PKI Request MUST be used; it MUST be encapsulated in a
   SignedData; and the SignedData MUST be constructed in accordance with
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8755" title="&quot;Using Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite Algorithms in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions&quot;">RFC8755</a>].  The PKIData content type defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5272" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)&quot;">RFC5272</a>] is used
   with the following additional requirements:

   *  controlSequence SHOULD be present.

      -  TransactionId and SenderNonce SHOULD be included.  Other CMC
         controls MAY be included.

      -  If the request is being authenticated using a shared-secret,
         then Identity Proof Version 2 control MUST be included with the
         following constraints:

         o  hashAlgId MUST be id-sha384 for all certification requests
            (algorithm OIDs are defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5754" title="&quot;Using SHA2 Algorithms with Cryptographic Message Syntax&quot;">RFC5754</a>]).

         o  macAlgId MUST be HMAC-SHA384 (the Hashed Message
            Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithm is defined in
            [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4231" title="&quot;Identifiers and Test Vectors for HMAC-SHA- 224, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512&quot;">RFC4231</a>]).

      -  If the subject name included in the certification request is
         NULL or otherwise does not uniquely identify the end-entity,
         then the POP Link Random control MUST be included, and the POP
         Link Witness Version 2 control MUST be included in the inner
         PKCS #10 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2986" title="&quot;PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7&quot;">RFC2986</a>] or Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)
         [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4211" title="&quot;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)&quot;">RFC4211</a>] request as described in Sections <a href="#section-4.1">4.1</a> and <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.

      for the orm choice is OPTIONAL.

   The private signing key used to generate the encapsulating SignedData
   MUST correspond to the public key of an existing signature
   certificate unless an appropriate signature certificate does not yet
   exist, such as during initial enrollment.

   The encapsulating SignedData MUST be generated using SHA-384 and
   either ECDSA on P-384 or RSA using either RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 or
   RSASSA-PSS with an RSA-3072 or RSA-4096 key.

   If an appropriate signature certificate does not yet exist and if a
   Full PKI Request includes one or more certification requests and is
   authenticated using a shared-secret (because no appropriate
   certificate exists yet to authenticate the request), the Full PKI
   Request MUST be signed using the private key corresponding to the
   public key of one of the requested certificates.  When necessary
   (i.e., because there is no existing signature certificate and there
   is no signature certification request included), a Full PKI Request
   MAY be signed using a key pair intended for use in a key
   establishment certificate.  However, servers are not required to
   allow this behavior.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  RA Requirements</span>

   This section addresses the optional case where one or more RAs act as
   intermediaries between clients and a CA as described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc5272#section-7">Section&nbsp;7 of
   [RFC5272]</a>.  In this section, the term &quot;client&quot; refers to the entity
   from which the RA received the PKI Request.  This section is only
   applicable to RAs.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  RA Processing of Requests</span>

   RAs conforming to this document MUST ensure that only the permitted
   signature, hash, and MAC algorithms described throughout this profile
   are used in requests; if they are not, the RA MUST reject those
   requests.  The RA SHOULD return a CMCFailInfo with the value of
   badAlg [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5272" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)&quot;">RFC5272</a>].

   When processing end-entity-generated SignedData objects, RAs MUST NOT
   perform Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Constraints (CCC)
   certificate extension processing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6010" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Constraints Extension&quot;">RFC6010</a>].

   Other RA processing is performed as described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5272" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)&quot;">RFC5272</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  RA-Generated PKI Requests</span>

   RAs mediate the certificate request process by collecting client

   Request encapsulated in a SignedData, and the SignedData MUST be
   constructed in accordance with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8755" title="&quot;Using Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite Algorithms in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions&quot;">RFC8755</a>].  The PKIData content type
   complies with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5272" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)&quot;">RFC5272</a>] with the following additional requirements:

   *  controlSequence MUST be present.  It MUST include the following
      CMC controls: Transaction ID, Sender Nonce, and Batch Requests.
      Other appropriate CMC controls MAY be included.

   *  cmsSequence MUST be present.  It contains the original, unmodified
      request(s) received from the client.

               {SignedData     (second client request)
                 PKIData...}

   Authorization to sign RA-generated Full PKI Requests SHOULD be
   indicated in the RA certificate by inclusion of the id-kp-cmcRA
   Extended Key Usage (EKU) from [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6402" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates&quot;">RFC6402</a>].  The RA certificate MAY also
   include the CCC certificate extension [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6010" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Constraints Extension&quot;">RFC6010</a>], or it MAY indicate
   authorization through inclusion of the CCC certificate extension
   alone.  The RA certificate may also be authorized through the local
   configuration.

   If the RA is authorized via the CCC extension, then the CCC extension
   MUST include the object identifier for the PKIData content type.  CCC
   SHOULD be included if constraints are to be placed on the content
   types generated.

   The outer SignedData MUST be generated using SHA-384 and either ECDSA
   on P-384 or RSA using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 or RSASSA-PSS with an
   RSA-3072 or RSA-4096 key.

   If the Full PKI Response is a successful response to a PKI Request
   that only contained a Get Certificate or Get CRL control, then the
   algorithm used in the response MUST match the algorithm used in the
   request.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  RA-Generated PKI Responses</span>

   In order for an RA certificate using the CCC certificate extension to

   extension.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  CA Requirements</span>

   This section specifies the requirements for CAs that receive PKI
   Requests and generate PKI Responses.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  CA Processing of PKI Requests</span>

   CAs conforming to this document MUST ensure that only the permitted
   signature, hash, and MAC algorithms described throughout this profile
   are used in requests; if they are not, the CA MUST reject those
   requests.  The CA SHOULD return a CMCStatusInfoV2 control with a
   CMCStatus of failed and a CMCFailInfo with the value of badAlg
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5272" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)&quot;">RFC5272</a>].

   For requests involving an RA (i.e., batched requests), the CA MUST
   verify the RA&#x27;s authorization.  The following certificate fields MUST
   NOT be modifiable using the Modify Certification Request control:
   publicKey and the keyUsage extension.  The request MUST be rejected
   if an attempt to modify those certification request fields is
   present.  The CA SHOULD return a CMCStatusInfoV2 control with a
   CMCStatus of failed and a CMCFailInfo with a value of badRequest.

   When processing end-entity-generated SignedData objects, CAs MUST NOT
   perform CCC certificate extension processing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6010" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Constraints Extension&quot;">RFC6010</a>].

   If a client-generated PKI Request includes the ChangeSubjectName
   attribute as described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> or 4.2 above, the CA MUST
   ensure that name change is authorized.  The mechanism for ensuring
   that the name change is authorized is out of scope.  A CA that
   performs this check and finds that the name change is not authorized
   MUST reject the PKI Request.  The CA SHOULD return an Extended CMC
   Status Info control (CMCStatusInfoV2) with a CMCStatus of failed.

   Other processing of PKIRequests is performed as described in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5272" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)&quot;">RFC5272</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  CA-Generated PKI Responses</span>

   CAs send PKI Responses to both client-generated requests and RA-
   generated requests.  If a Full PKI Response is returned in direct
   response to a client-generated request, it MUST be encapsulated in a
   SignedData, and the SignedData MUST be constructed in accordance with
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8755" title="&quot;Using Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite Algorithms in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions&quot;">RFC8755</a>].

   If the PKI Response is in response to an RA-generated PKI Request,
   then the above PKI Response is encapsulated in another CA-generated
   PKI Response.  That PKI Response MUST be encapsulated in a
   SignedData, and the SignedData MUST be constructed in accordance with
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8755" title="&quot;Using Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite Algorithms in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions&quot;">RFC8755</a>].  The above PKI Response is placed in the encapsulating PKI
   Response cmsSequence field.  The other fields are as above with the
   addition of the batch response control in controlSequence.  The
   following illustrates a successful CA response to an RA-encapsulated
   PKI Request, both of which include Transaction IDs and Nonces:

         SignedData (applied by the CA)
           PKIResponse
             controlSequence (Transaction ID, Sender Nonce, Recipient
                              Nonce, Batch Response)
             cmsSequence
               SignedData (applied by CA and includes returned
                           certificates)
                 PKIResponse
                   controlSequence (Transaction ID, Sender Nonce,
                                    Recipient Nonce)

   The same private key used to sign certificates MUST NOT be used to
   sign Full PKI Response messages.  Instead, a separate certificate
   indicating authorization to sign CMC responses MUST be used.

   Authorization to sign Full PKI Responses SHOULD be indicated in the
   CA certificate by inclusion of the id-kp-cmcCA EKU from [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6402" title="&quot;Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates&quot;">RFC6402</a>].
   The CA certificate MAY also include the CCC certificate extension
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6010" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Constraints Extension&quot;">RFC6010</a>], or it MAY indicate authorization through inclusion of the
   CCC certificate extension alone.  The CA certificate may also be
   authorized through local configuration.

   In order for a CA certificate using the CCC certificate extension to
   be authorized to generate responses, the object identifier for the
   PKIResponse content type must be present in the CCC certificate
   extension.  CCC SHOULD be included if constraints are to be placed on
   the content types generated.

   Signatures applied to individual certificates are as required in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8603" title="&quot;Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile&quot;">RFC8603</a>].

   The signature on the SignedData of a successful response to a client-
   generated request, or each individual inner SignedData on the
   successful response to an RA-generated request, MUST be generated
   using SHA-384 and either ECDSA on P-384 or RSA using RSASSA-
   PKCS1-v1_5 or RSASSA-PSS with an RSA-3072 or RSA-4096 key.  An
   unsuccessful response MUST be signed using the same key type and
   algorithm that signed the request.

   The outer SignedData on the Full PKI Response to any RA-generated PKI
   Request MUST be signed with the same key type and algorithm that
   signed the request.

   The SignedData on a successful Full PKI Response to a PKI Request
   that only contained a Get Certificate or Get CRL control MUST be
   signed with the same key type and algorithm that signed the request.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Client Requirements: Processing PKI Responses</span>

   Clients conforming to this document MUST ensure that only the
   permitted signature, hash, and MAC algorithms described throughout
   this profile are used in responses; if they are not, the client MUST
   reject those responses.

   Clients MUST authenticate all Full PKI Responses.  This includes
   verifying that the PKI Response is signed by an authorized CA or RA
   whose certificate validates back to a trust anchor.  The authorized
   CA certificate MUST include the id-kp-cmcCA EKU and/or a CCC
   extension that includes the object identifier for the PKIResponse
   content type.  Otherwise, the CA is determined to be authorized to
   sign responses through an implementation-specific mechanism.  The PKI
   Response can be signed by an RA if it is an error message, if it is a
   response to a Get Certificate or Get CRL request, or if the PKI
   Response contains an inner PKI Response signed by a CA.  In the last
   case, each layer of PKI Response MUST still contain an authorized,
   valid signature signed by an entity with a valid certificate that
   verifies back to an acceptable trust anchor.  The authorized RA
   certificate MUST include the id-kp-cmcRA EKU and/or include a CCC
   extension that includes the object identifier for the PKIResponse
   content type.  Otherwise, the RA is determined to be authorized to
   sign responses through local configuration.

   When a newly issued certificate is included in the PKI Response, the
   client MUST verify that the newly issued certificate&#x27;s public key
   matches the public key that the client requested.  The client MUST
   also ensure that the certificate&#x27;s signature is valid and that the
   signature validates back to an acceptable trust anchor.

   Clients MUST reject PKI Responses that do not pass these tests.
   Local policy will determine whether the client returns a Full PKI
   Response with an Extended CMC Status Info control (CMCStatusInfoV2)
   with the CMCStatus set to failed to a user console, error log, or the
   server.

   If the Full PKI Response contains an Extended CMC Status Info control
   with a CMCStatus set to failed, then local policy will determine
   whether the client resends a duplicate certification request back to
   the server or an error state is returned to a console or error log.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Shared-Secrets</span>

   When the Identity Proof V2 and POP Link Witness V2 controls are used,

   key establishment.

   This specification requires implementations to generate key pairs and
   other random values.  The use of inadequate pseudorandom number
   generators (PRNGs) can result in little or no security.  The
   generation of quality random numbers is difficult.  NIST Special
   Publication 800-90A [<a href="#ref-SP80090A" title="&quot;Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators&quot;">SP80090A</a>], FIPS 186-3 [<a href="#ref-FIPS186" title="&quot;Digital Signature Standard (DSS)&quot;">FIPS186</a>], and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4086" title="&quot;Randomness Requirements for Security&quot;">RFC4086</a>]
   offer random number generation guidance.

   When RAs are used, the list of authorized RAs MUST be securely
   distributed out of band to CAs.

   Presence of the POP Link Witness Version 2 and POP Link Random
   attributes protects against substitution attacks.

   The certificate policy for a particular environment will specify
   whether expired certificates can be used to sign certification
   requests.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Scenarios</span>

   This section illustrates several potential certificate enrollment and
   rekey scenarios supported by this profile.  This section does not
   intend to place any limits or restrictions on the use of CMC.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.1" href="#appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Initial Enrollment</span>

   This section describes three scenarios for authenticating initial
   enrollment requests:

   1.  Previously certified signature key-pair (e.g., Manufacturer
       Installed Certificate).

   2.  Shared-secret distributed securely out of band.

   3.  RA authentication.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.1.1" href="#appendix-A.1.1">A.1.1</a>.  Previously Certified Signature Key-Pair</span>

   In this scenario, the end-entity has a private signing key and a
   corresponding public key certificate obtained from a cryptographic
   module manufacturer recognized by the CA.  The end-entity signs a
   Full PKI Request with the private key that corresponds to the subject
   public key of the previously installed signature certificate.  The CA
   will verify the authorization of the previously installed certificate
   and issue an appropriate new certificate to the end-entity.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.1.2" href="#appendix-A.1.2">A.1.2</a>.  Shared-Secret Distributed Securely Out of Band</span>

   In this scenario, the CA distributes a shared-secret out of band to
   the end-entity that the end-entity uses to authenticate its
   certification request.  The end-entity signs the Full PKI Request
   with the private key for which the certification is being requested.
   The end-entity includes the Identity Proof Version 2 control to
   authenticate the request using the shared-secret.  The CA uses either
   the Identification control or the subject name in the end-entity&#x27;s
   enclosed PKCS #10 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2986" title="&quot;PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7&quot;">RFC2986</a>] or CRMF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4211" title="&quot;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)&quot;">RFC4211</a>] certification request
   message to identify the request.  The end-entity performs either the
   POP Link Witness Version 2 mechanism as described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc5272#section-6.3.1.1">[RFC5272],
   Section&nbsp;6.3.1.1</a> or the shared-secret/subject distinguished name
   linking mechanism as described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc5272#section-6.3.2">[RFC5272], Section&nbsp;6.3.2</a>.  The
   subject name in the enclosed PKCS #10 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2986" title="&quot;PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7&quot;">RFC2986</a>] or CRMF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4211" title="&quot;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)&quot;">RFC4211</a>]
   certification request does not necessarily match the issued
   certificate, as it may be used just to help identify the request (and
   the corresponding shared-secret) to the CA.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.1.3" href="#appendix-A.1.3">A.1.3</a>.  RA Authentication</span>

   In this scenario, the end-entity does not automatically authenticate
   its enrollment request to the CA, either because the end-entity has
   nothing to authenticate the request with or because the
   organizational policy requires an RA&#x27;s involvement.  The end-entity
   creates a Full PKI Request and sends it to an RA.  The RA verifies
   the authenticity of the request.  If the request is approved, the RA
   encapsulates and signs the request as described in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>,
   forwarding the new request on to the CA.  The subject name in the
   PKCS #10 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2986" title="&quot;PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7&quot;">RFC2986</a>] or CRMF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4211" title="&quot;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)&quot;">RFC4211</a>] certification request is not
   required to match the issued certificate; it may be used just to help
   identify the request to the RA and/or CA.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.2" href="#appendix-A.2">A.2</a>.  Rekey</span>

   There are two scenarios to support the rekey of certificates that are
   already enrolled.  One addresses the rekey of signature certificates,
   and the other addresses the rekey of key establishment certificates.
   Typically, organizational policy will require certificates to be
   currently valid to be rekeyed, and it may require initial enrollment
   to be repeated when rekey is not possible.  However, some
   organizational policies might allow a grace period during which an
   expired certificate could be used to rekey.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.2.1" href="#appendix-A.2.1">A.2.1</a>.  Rekey of Signature Certificates</span>

   When a signature certificate is rekeyed, the PKCS #10 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2986" title="&quot;PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7&quot;">RFC2986</a>] or
   CRMF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4211" title="&quot;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)&quot;">RFC4211</a>] certification request message enclosed in the Full PKI
   Request will include the same subject name as the current signature
   certificate.  The Full PKI Request will be signed by the current
   private key corresponding to the current signature certificate.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.2.2" href="#appendix-A.2.2">A.2.2</a>.  Rekey of Key Establishment Certificates</span>

   When a key establishment certificate is rekeyed, the Full PKI Request
   will generally be signed by the current private key corresponding to
   the current signature certificate.  If there is no current signature
   certificate, one of the initial enrollment options in <a href="#appendix-A.1">Appendix A.1</a>
   may be used.
