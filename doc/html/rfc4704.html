<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   DNS ([<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Domain names - concepts and facilities&quot;">2</a>], [<a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Domain names - implementation and specification&quot;">3</a>]) maintains (among other things) the information about
   mapping between hosts&#x27; Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) [<a href="#ref-10" title="&quot;FYI on Questions and Answers - Answers to Commonly asked &quot;">10</a>] and
   IPv6 addresses assigned to the hosts.  The information is maintained
   in two types of Resource Records (RRs): AAAA and PTR [<a href="#ref-12" title="&quot;DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6&quot;">12</a>].  The DNS
   update specification [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE)&quot;">4</a>] describes a mechanism that enables DNS
   information to be updated over a network.

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)&quot;">5</a>]
   provides a mechanism by which a host (a DHCPv6 client) can acquire
   certain configuration information, along with its stateful IPv6
   address(es).  This document specifies a new DHCPv6 option, the Client
   FQDN option, which can be used by DHCPv6 clients and servers to
   exchange information about the client&#x27;s fully qualified domain name
   and about who has the responsibility for updating the DNS with the
   associated AAAA and PTR RRs.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">1</a>].

   Familiarity with the DNS Update protocol [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE)&quot;">4</a>] and with DHCPv6 and its
   terminology, as defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)&quot;">5</a>], is assumed.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Models of Operation</span>

   When a DHCPv6 client acquires an address, a site&#x27;s administrator may
   desire that the AAAA RR for the client&#x27;s FQDN and the PTR RR for the
   acquired address be updated.  Therefore, two separate DNS update
   transactions may occur.  Acquiring an address via DHCPv6 involves two
   entities: a DHCPv6 client and a DHCPv6 server.  In principle, each of
   these entities could perform none, one, or both of the DNS update
   transactions.  However, in practice, not all permutations make sense.
   The DHCPv6 Client FQDN option is primarily intended to operate in the
   following two cases:

   1.  DHCPv6 client updates the AAAA RR; DHCPv6 server updates the PTR
       RR.

   2.  DHCPv6 server updates both the AAAA and the PTR RRs.

   The only difference between these two cases is whether the FQDN-to-
   IPv6-address mapping is updated by a DHCPv6 client or by a DHCPv6
   server.  The IPv6-address-to-FQDN mapping is updated by a DHCPv6
   server in both cases.



<span class="grey">Volz                        Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-4" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc4704">RFC 4704</a>             The DHCPv6 Client FQDN Option          October 2006</span>


   The reason these two are important, while others are unlikely, has to
   do with authority over the respective DNS domain names.  A DHCPv6
   client may be given authority over mapping its own AAAA RRs, or that
   authority may be restricted to a server to prevent the client from
   listing arbitrary addresses or associating its addresses with
   arbitrary domain names.  In all cases, the only reasonable place for
   the authority over the PTR RRs associated with the address is in the
   DHCPv6 server that allocates the address.

   Note: A third case is supported in which the client requests that the
   server perform no updates.  However, this case is presumed to be rare
   because of the authority issues.

   In any case, whether a site permits all, some, or no DHCPv6 servers
   and clients to perform DNS updates into the zones that it controls is
   entirely a matter of local administrative policy.  This document does
   not require any specific administrative policy and does not propose
   one.  The range of possible policies is very broad, from sites where
   only the DHCPv6 servers have been given credentials that the DNS
   servers will accept, to sites where each individual DHCPv6 client has
   been configured with credentials that allow the client to modify its
   own domain name.  Compliant implementations MAY support some or all
   of these possibilities.  Furthermore, this specification applies only
   to DHCPv6 client and server processes: it does not apply to other
   processes that initiate DNS updates.

   This document describes a new DHCPv6 option that a client can use to
   convey all or part of its domain name to a DHCPv6 server.  Site-
   specific policy determines whether or not DHCPv6 servers use the
   names that clients offer, and what DHCPv6 servers do in cases where
   clients do not supply domain names.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  The DHCPv6 Client FQDN Option</span>

   To update the IPv6-address-to-FQDN mapping, a DHCPv6 server needs to
   know the FQDN of the client for the addresses for the client&#x27;s IA_NA
   bindings.  To allow the client to convey its FQDN to the server, this
   document defines a new DHCPv6 option called &quot;Client FQDN&quot;.  The
   Client FQDN option also contains Flags that DHCPv6 clients and
   servers use to negotiate who does which updates.

   The code for this option is 39.  Its minimum length is 1 octet.

   The &quot;S&quot; bit indicates whether the server SHOULD or SHOULD NOT perform

   0 to indicate that the server SHOULD NOT perform the updates and 1 to
   indicate that the server SHOULD perform the updates.  The state of
   the bit in the reply from the server indicates the action to be taken
   by the server; if it is 1, the server has taken responsibility for
   AAAA RR updates for the FQDN.

   The &quot;O&quot; bit indicates whether the server has overridden the client&#x27;s
   preference for the &quot;S&quot; bit.  A client MUST set this bit to 0.  A
   server MUST set this bit to 1 if the &quot;S&quot; bit in its reply to the
   client does not match the &quot;S&quot; bit received from the client.

   The &quot;N&quot; bit indicates whether the server SHOULD NOT perform any DNS
   updates.  A client sets this bit to 0 to request that the server
   SHOULD perform updates (the PTR RR and possibly the AAAA RR based on
   the &quot;S&quot; bit) or to 1 to request that the server SHOULD NOT perform
   any DNS updates.  A server sets the &quot;N&quot; bit to indicate whether the
   server SHALL (0) or SHALL NOT (1) perform DNS updates.  If the &quot;N&quot;
   bit is 1, the &quot;S&quot; bit MUST be 0.

   The remaining bits in the Flags field are reserved for future
   assignment.  DHCPv6 clients and servers that send the Client FQDN
   option MUST clear the MBZ bits, and they MUST ignore these bits.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  The Domain Name Field</span>

   The Domain Name part of the option carries all or part of the FQDN of
   a DHCPv6 client.  The data in the Domain Name field MUST be encoded
   as described in Section 8 of [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)&quot;">5</a>].  In order to determine whether the
   FQDN has changed between message exchanges, the client and server
   MUST NOT alter the Domain Name field contents unless the FQDN has
   actually changed.

   A client MAY be configured with a fully qualified domain name or with
   a partial name that is not fully qualified.  If a client knows only
   part of its name, it MAY send a name that is not fully qualified,
   indicating that it knows part of the name but does not necessarily
   know the zone in which the name is to be embedded.

   To send a fully qualified domain name, the Domain Name field is set
   to the DNS-encoded domain name including the terminating zero-length
   label.  To send a partial name, the Domain Name field is set to the
   DNS-encoded domain name without the terminating zero-length label.

   A client MAY also leave the Domain Name field empty if it desires the
   server to provide a name.

   Servers SHOULD send the complete fully qualified domain name in
   Client FQDN options.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior</span>

   The following describes the behavior of a DHCPv6 client that
   implements the Client FQDN option.

   A client MUST only include the Client FQDN option in SOLICIT,
   REQUEST, RENEW, or REBIND messages.

   A client that sends the Client FQDN option MUST also include the
   option in the Option Request option if it expects the server to
   include the Client FQDN option in any responses.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Client Desires to Update AAAA RRs</span>

   If a client that owns/maintains its own FQDN wants to be responsible
   for updating the FQDN-to-IPv6-address mapping for the FQDN and
   address(es) used by the client, the client MUST include the Client
   FQDN option in the SOLICIT with Rapid Commit, REQUEST, RENEW, and
   REBIND message originated by the client.  A client MAY choose to
   include the Client FQDN option in its SOLICIT messages.  The &quot;S&quot;,
   &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;N&quot; bits in the Flags field in the option MUST be 0.

   Once the client&#x27;s DHCPv6 configuration is completed (the client
   receives a REPLY message and successfully completes a final check on
   the parameters passed in the message), the client MAY originate an
   update for the AAAA RRs (associated with the client&#x27;s FQDN) unless
   the server has set the &quot;S&quot; bit to 1.  If the &quot;S&quot; is 1, the DHCPv6
   client SHOULD NOT initiate an update for the name in the server&#x27;s
   returned Client FQDN option Domain Name field.  However, a DHCPv6
   client that is explicitly configured with a FQDN MAY ignore the state
   of the &quot;S&quot; bit if the server&#x27;s returned name matches the client&#x27;s
   configured name.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Client Desires Server to Do DNS Updates</span>

   A client can choose to delegate the responsibility for updating the
   FQDN-to-IPv6-address mapping for the FQDN and address(es) used by the
   client to the server.  In order to inform the server of this choice,
   the client SHOULD include the Client FQDN option in its SOLICIT with
   Rapid Commit, REQUEST, RENEW, and REBIND messages and MAY include the
   Client FQDN option in its SOLICIT.  The &quot;S&quot; bit in the Flags field in

   Rapid Commit, REQUEST, RENEW, and REBIND messages and MAY include the
   Client FQDN option in its SOLICIT.  The &quot;N&quot; bit in the Flags field in
   the option MUST be 1, and the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;O&quot; bits MUST be 0.

   Once the client&#x27;s DHCPv6 configuration is completed (the client
   receives a REPLY message and successfully completes a final check on
   the parameters passed in the message), the client MAY originate its
   DNS updates provided the server&#x27;s &quot;N&quot; bit is 1.  If the server&#x27;s &quot;N&quot;
   bit is 0, the server MAY perform the PTR RR updates; it MAY also
   perform the AAAA RR updates if the &quot;S&quot; bit is 1.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.4" href="#section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Domain Name and DNS Update Issues</span>

   As there is a possibility that the DHCPv6 server is configured to
   complete or replace a domain name that the client sends, the client
   MAY find it useful to send the Client FQDN option in its SOLICIT
   messages.  If the DHCPv6 server returns different Domain Name data in
   its ADVERTISE message, the client could use that data in performing
   its own eventual AAAA RR update, or in forming the Client FQDN option
   that it sends in its subsequent messages.  There is no requirement
   that the client send identical Client FQDN option data in its
   SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, or REBIND messages.  In particular, if a
   client has sent the Client FQDN option to its server, and the
   configuration of the client changes so that its notion of its domain
   name changes, it MAY send the new name data in a Client FQDN option
   when it communicates with the server again.  This MAY cause the
   DHCPv6 server to update the name associated with the PTR records and,
   if the server updated the AAAA record representing the client, to
   delete that record and attempt an update for the client&#x27;s current
   domain name.

   A client that delegates the responsibility for updating the FQDN-to-
   IPv6-address mapping to a server will not receive any indication
   (either positive or negative) from the server as to whether the
   server was able to perform the update.  The client MAY use a DNS
   query to check whether the mapping is up to date.  However, depending
   on the load on the DHCPv6 and DNS servers and the DNS propagation
   delays, the client can only infer success.  If the information is not
   found to be up to date in DNS, the authoritative servers might not
   have completed the updates or zone transfers, or caching resolvers
   may yet have updated their caches.

   If a client releases an address prior to the expiration of the valid
   lifetime and the client is responsible for updating its AAAA RR, the
   client SHOULD delete the AAAA RR associated with the address before
   sending a RELEASE message.  Similarly, if a client is responsible for
   updating its AAAA RRs, but is unable to renew the lifetimes for an
   address, the client SHOULD attempt to delete the AAAA RR before the

   lifetime on the address is no longer valid.  A DHCPv6 client that has
   not been able to delete an AAAA RR that it added SHOULD attempt to
   notify its administrator, perhaps by emitting a log message.

   A client SHOULD NOT perform DNS updates to AAAA RRs for its non-
   Global Unicast addresses [<a href="#ref-7" title="&quot;IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture&quot;">7</a>] or temporary addresses [<a href="#ref-6" title="&quot;Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6&quot;">6</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior</span>

   The following describes the behavior of a DHCPv6 server that
   implements the Client FQDN option when the client&#x27;s message includes
   the Client FQDN option.

   Servers MUST only include a Client FQDN option in ADVERTISE and REPLY
   messages if the client included a Client FQDN option and the Client
   FQDN option is requested by the Option Request option in the client&#x27;s
   message to which the server is responding.

   The server examines its configuration and the Flag bits in the
   client&#x27;s Client FQDN option to determine how to respond:

   o  The server sets to 0 the &quot;S&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;N&quot; bits in its copy of the
      option it will return to the client.

   o  If the client&#x27;s &quot;N&quot; bit is 1 and the server&#x27;s configuration allows
      it to honor the client&#x27;s request for no server-initiated DNS
      updates, the server sets the &quot;N&quot; bit to 1.

   o  Otherwise, if the client&#x27;s &quot;S&quot; bit is 1 and the server&#x27;s
      configuration allows it to honor the client&#x27;s request for the
      server to initiate AAAA RR DNS updates, the server sets the &quot;S&quot; to
      1.  If the server&#x27;s &quot;S&quot; bit does not match the client&#x27;s &quot;S&quot; bit,
      the server sets the &quot;O&quot; bit to 1.

   The server MAY be configured to use the name supplied in the client&#x27;s
   Client FQDN option, or it MAY be configured to modify the supplied
   name or to substitute a different name.  The server SHOULD send its
   notion of the complete FQDN for the client in the Domain Name field.
   The server MAY simply copy the Domain Name field from the Client FQDN
   option that the client sent to the server.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  When to Perform DNS Updates</span>

   The server SHOULD NOT perform any DNS updates if the &quot;N&quot; bit is 1 in
   the Flags field of the Client FQDN option in the REPLY messages (to
   be) sent to the client.  However, the server SHOULD delete any RRs
   that it previously added via DNS updates for the client.

   The server MAY perform the PTR RR DNS update (unless the &quot;N&quot; bit is
   1).

   The server MAY perform the AAAA RR DNS update if the &quot;S&quot; bit is 1 in
   the Flags field of the Client FQDN option in the REPLY message (to
   be) sent to the client.

   The server MAY perform these updates even if the client&#x27;s message did
   not carry the Client FQDN option.  The server MUST NOT initiate DNS
   updates when responding with an ADVERTISE message to the client.

   The server MAY complete its DNS updates (PTR RR or PTR and AAAA RR)
   before or after sending the REPLY message to the client.

   If the server&#x27;s AAAA RR DNS update does not complete until after the
   server has replied to the DHCPv6 client, the server&#x27;s interaction
   with the DNS server MAY cause the DHCPv6 server to change the domain
   name that it associates with the client.  This can occur, for
   example, if the server detects and resolves a domain-name conflict
   [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Resolution of Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Conflicts among Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Clients&quot;">8</a>].  In such cases, the domain name that the server returns to the
   DHCPv6 client would change between two DHCPv6 exchanges.

   If the server previously performed DNS updates for the client and the
   client&#x27;s information has not changed, the server MAY skip performing
   additional DNS updates.

   When a server receives a RELEASE or DECLINE for an address, detects
   that the valid lifetime on an address that the server bound to a
   client has expired, or terminates a binding on an address prior to
   the binding&#x27;s expiration time (for instance, by sending a REPLY with
   a zero valid lifetime for an address), the server SHOULD delete any
   PTR RR that it associated with the address via DNS update.  In
   addition, if the server took responsibility for AAAA RRs, the server
   SHOULD also delete the AAAA RR.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  DNS RR TTLs</span>

   RRs associated with DHCP clients may be more volatile than statically
   configured RRs.  DHCP clients and servers that perform dynamic
   updates should attempt to specify resource record TTLs that reflect
   this volatility, in order to minimize the possibility that answers to
   DNS queries will return records that refer to DHCP IP address
   assignments that have expired or been released.

   The coupling among primary, secondary, and caching DNS servers is
   &#x27;loose&#x27;; that is a fundamental part of the design of the DNS.  This
   looseness makes it impossible to prevent all possible situations in
   which a resolver may return a record reflecting a DHCP-assigned IP

   address that has expired or been released.  In deployment, this
   rarely, if ever, represents a significant problem.  Most DHCP-managed
   clients are infrequently looked up by name in the DNS, and the
   deployment of IXFR [<a href="#ref-13" title="&quot;Incremental Zone Transfer in DNS&quot;">13</a>] and NOTIFY [<a href="#ref-14" title="&quot;A Mechanism for Prompt Notification of Zone Changes (DNS NOTIFY)&quot;">14</a>] can reduce the latency
   between updates and their visibility at secondary servers.

   We suggest these basic guidelines for implementers.  In general, the
   TTLs for RRs added as a result of DHCP IP address assignment activity
   SHOULD be less than the initial lifetime.  The RR TTL on a DNS record
   added SHOULD NOT exceed 1/3 of the lifetime, but SHOULD NOT be less
   than 10 minutes.  We recognize that individual administrators will
   have varying requirements: DHCP servers and clients SHOULD allow
   administrators to configure TTLs and upper and lower bounds on the
   TTL values, either as an absolute time interval or as a percentage of
   the lease lifetime.

   While clients and servers MAY update the TTL of the records as the
   lifetime is about to expire, there is no requirement that they do so
   as this puts additional load on the DNS system with likely little
   benefit.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  DNS Update Conflicts</span>

   This document does not resolve how a DHCPv6 client or server prevent
   name conflicts.  This document addresses only how a DHCPv6 client and
   server negotiate the fully qualified domain name and who will perform
   the DNS updates.

   Implementers of this work will need to consider how name conflicts
   will be prevented.  If a DNS updater needs a security token in order
   to successfully perform DNS updates on a specific name, name
   conflicts can only occur if multiple updaters are given a security
   token for that name.  Or, if the fully qualified domains are based on
   the specific address bound to a client, conflicts will not occur.
   Or, a name conflict resolution technique as described in &quot;Resolving
   Name Conflicts&quot; [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Resolution of Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Conflicts among Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Clients&quot;">8</a>]) SHOULD be used.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-10" href="#section-10">10</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Unauthenticated updates to the DNS can lead to tremendous confusion,
   through malicious attack or through inadvertent misconfiguration.
   Administrators need to be wary of permitting unsecured DNS updates to
   zones that are exposed to the global Internet.  Both DHCPv6 clients
   and servers SHOULD use some form of update request origin
   authentication procedure (e.g., Secure DNS Dynamic Update [<a href="#ref-11" title="&quot;Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Dynamic Update&quot;">11</a>]) when
   performing DNS updates.

   Whether a DHCPv6 client is responsible for updating an FQDN-to-IPv6-
   address mapping or whether this is the responsibility of the DHCPv6
   server is a site-local matter.  The choice between the two
   alternatives is likely based on the security model that is used with
   the DNS update protocol (e.g., only a client may have sufficient
   credentials to perform updates to the FQDN-to-IPv6-address mapping
   for its FQDN).

   Whether a DHCPv6 server is always responsible for updating the FQDN-
   to-IPv6-address mapping (in addition to updating the IPv6-to-FQDN
   mapping), regardless of the wishes of an individual DHCPv6 client, is
   also a site-local matter.  The choice between the two alternatives is
   likely based on the security model that is being used with DNS
   updates.  In cases where a DHCPv6 server is performing DNS updates on
   behalf of a client, the DHCPv6 server SHOULD be sure of the DNS name
   to use for the client, and of the identity of the client.

   Depending on the presence of or type of authentication used with the
   Authentication option, a DHCPv6 server may not have much confidence
   in the identities of its clients.  There are many ways for a DHCPv6
   server to develop a DNS name to use for a client, but only in certain
   circumstances will the DHCPv6 server know for certain the identity of
   the client.

   It is critical to implement proper conflict resolution, and the
   security considerations of conflict resolution apply [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Resolution of Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Conflicts among Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Clients&quot;">8</a>].
