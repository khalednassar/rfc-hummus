Abstract

   This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO cost information
   service so that applications decide not only &#x27;where&#x27; to connect but
   also &#x27;when&#x27;.  This is useful for applications that need to perform
   bulk data transfer and would like to schedule these transfers during
   an off-peak hour, for example.  This extension introduces the ALTO
   Cost Calendar with which an ALTO Server exposes ALTO cost values in
   JSON arrays where each value corresponds to a given time interval.
   The time intervals, as well as other Calendar attributes, are
   specified in the Information Resources Directory and ALTO Server
   responses.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
   specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] provides guidance to overlay applications that
   need to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates able to
   provide a desired resource.  This guidance is based on parameters
   that affect performance and efficiency of the data transmission
   between the hosts, such as the topological distance.  The goal of
   ALTO is to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) in the application
   while optimizing resource usage in the underlying network
   infrastructure.

   The ALTO protocol in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] specifies a network map that defines
   groupings of endpoints in provider-defined network regions identified
   by Provider-defined Identifiers (PIDs).  The Cost Map Service,
   Endpoint Cost Service (ECS), and Endpoint Ranking Service then
   provide ISP-defined costs and rankings for connections among the
   specified endpoints and PIDs and thus incentives for application
   clients to connect to ISP-preferred locations, for instance, to
   reduce their costs.  For the reasons outlined in the ALTO problem
   statement [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5693" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement&quot;">RFC5693</a>] and requirement AR-14 of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6708" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Requirements&quot;">RFC6708</a>], ALTO does not
   disseminate network metrics that change frequently.  In a network,
   the costs can fluctuate for many reasons having to do with
   instantaneous traffic load or diurnal patterns of traffic demand or
   planned events, such as network maintenance, holidays, or highly
   publicized events.  Thus, an ALTO application wishing to use the Cost
   Map and Endpoint Cost Service at some future time will have to
   estimate the state of the network at that time, a process that is, at
   best, fragile and brittle, since the application does not have any
   visibility into the state of the network.  Providing network costs
   for only the current time thus may not be sufficient, in particular
   for applications that can schedule their traffic in a span of time,
   for example, by deferring backups or other background traffic to off-
   peak hours.

   In case the ALTO cost value changes are predictable over a certain
   period of time and the application does not require immediate data
   transfer, it can save time to get the whole set of cost values over
   this period in one single ALTO response.  Using this set to schedule
   data transfers allows optimizing the network resources usage and QoE.
   ALTO Clients and Servers can also minimize their workload by reducing
   and accordingly scheduling their data exchanges.

   This document extends [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] to allow an ALTO Server to provide
   network costs for a given duration of time.  A sequence of network
   costs across a time span for a given pair of network locations is
   named an &quot;ALTO Cost Calendar&quot;.  The Filtered Cost Map Service and
   Endpoint Cost Service are extended to provide Cost Calendars.  In
   addition to this functional ALTO enhancement, we expect to further
   save network and storage resources by gathering multiple cost values
   for one cost type into one single ALTO Server response.

   In this document, an &quot;ALTO Cost Calendar&quot; is specified in terms of
   information resource capabilities that are applicable to time-
   sensitive ALTO metrics.  An ALTO Cost Calendar exposes ALTO cost
   values in JSON arrays, see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>], where each value corresponds to
   a given time interval.  The time intervals, as well as other Calendar
   attributes, are specified in the Information Resources Directory
   (IRD) and in the Server response to allow the ALTO Client to
   interpret the received ALTO values.  Last, the extensions for ALTO
   Calendars are applicable to any cost mode, and they ensure backwards
   compatibility with legacy ALTO Clients -- those that only support
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

   In the rest of this document, <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> provides the design
   characteristics.  Sections <a href="#section-4">4</a> and <a href="#section-5">5</a> define the formal specifications
   for the IRD and the information resources.  IANA, security
   considerations, and operational considerations are addressed
   respectively in Sections <a href="#section-6">6</a>, <a href="#section-7">7</a>, and <a href="#section-8">8</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Some Recent Known Uses</span>

   A potential use case is implementing smart network services that
   allow applications to dynamically build end-to-end, virtual networks
   to satisfy given demands with no manual intervention.  For example,
   data-transfer automation applications may need a network service to
   determine the availability of bandwidth resources to decide when to
   transfer their data sets.  The SENSE project [<a href="#ref-SENSE" title="&quot;SDN for End-to-End Networked Science at the Exascale (SENSE)&quot;">SENSE</a>] supports such
   applications by requiring that a network provides services such as
   the Time-Bandwidth-Product (TBP) service, which informs applications
   of bandwidth availability during a specific time period.  ALTO
   Calendars can support this service if the Calendar start date and
   duration cover the period of interest of the requesting application.

   The need of future scheduling of large-scale traffic that can be
   addressed by the ALTO protocol is also motivated by Unicorn, a
   unified resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-
   distributed data analytics, see [<a href="#ref-UNICORN-FGCS">UNICORN-FGCS</a>].

   This section gives a high-level overview of the design.  It assumes
   the reader is familiar with the ALTO protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] and its
   Multi-Cost ALTO extension [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  ALTO Cost Calendar Overview</span>

   An ALTO Cost Calendar provided by the ALTO Server provides 2
   information items:

   *  an array of values for a given metric, where each value specifies
      the metric corresponding to a time interval, where the value array
      can sometimes be a cyclic pattern that repeats a certain number of
      times and

   *  attributes describing the time scope of the Calendar, including
      the size and number of the intervals and the date of the starting
      point of the Calendar, allowing an ALTO Client to interpret the
      values properly.

   An ALTO Cost Calendar can be used like a &quot;time table&quot; to figure out
   the best time to schedule data transfers and also to proactively
   manage application traffic given predictable events, such as an
   expected spike in traffic due to crowd gathering (concerts, sports,
   etc.), traffic-intensive holidays, and network maintenance.  A
   Calendar may be viewed as a synthetic abstraction of, for example,
   real measurements gathered over previous periods on which statistics
   have been computed.  However, like for any schedule, unexpected
   network incidents may require the current ALTO Calendar to be updated
   and resent to the ALTO Clients needing it.  The &quot;ALTO Incremental
   Updates Using Server-Sent Events (SSE)&quot; Service [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8895" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Incremental Updates Using Server-Sent Events (SSE)&quot;">RFC8895</a>] can be used
   to directly update the Calendar upon value changes if supported by
   both the Server and the Client.

   Most likely, the ALTO Cost Calendar would be used for the Endpoint
   Cost Service, assuming that a limited set of feasible endpoints for a
   non-real time application is already identified, and that those
   endpoints do not need to be accessed immediately and that their
   access can be scheduled within a given time period.  The Filtered
   Cost Map Service is also applicable as long as the size of the Map
   allows it.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  ALTO Cost Calendar Information Features</span>

   The Calendar attributes are provided in the Information Resources
   Directory (IRD) and in ALTO Server responses.  The IRD announces
   attributes without date values in its information resources
   capabilities, whereas attributes with time-dependent values are
   provided in the &quot;meta&quot; section of Server responses.  The ALTO Cost
   Calendar attributes provide the following information:

   *  attributes to describe the time scope of the Calendar value array:

      -  &quot;time-interval-size&quot;: the applicable time interval size for
         each Calendar value, defined in seconds, that can cover a wide
         range of values.

      -  &quot;number-of-intervals&quot;: the number of intervals provided in the
         Calendar.

   *  &quot;calendar-start-time&quot;: specifying when the Calendar starts; that
      is, to which date the first value of the Cost Calendar is
      applicable.

   *  &quot;repeated&quot;: an optional attribute indicating how many iterations
      of the provided Calendar will have the same values.  The Server
      may use it to allow the Client to schedule its next request and
      thus save its own workload by reducing processing of similar
      requests.

   Attribute &quot;repeated&quot; may take a very high value if a Calendar
   represents a cyclic value pattern that the Server considers valid for
   a long period.  In this case, the Server will only update the
   Calendar values once this period has elapsed or if an unexpected
   event occurs on the network.  See <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> for more discussion.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  ALTO Calendar Design Characteristics</span>

   The present document uses the notations defined in &quot;Notation&quot;
   (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-8.2">Section&nbsp;8.2 of [RFC7285]</a>).

   The extensions in this document encode requests and responses using
   JSON [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>].

   In the base protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>], an ALTO cost is specified as a
   generic JSONValue [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>] to allow extensions.  However, that
   section (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-11.2.3.6">Section&nbsp;11.2.3.6 of [RFC7285]</a>) states:

   |  An implementation of the protocol in this document SHOULD assume
   |  that the cost is a JSONNumber and fail to parse if it is not,
   |  unless the implementation is using an extension to this document
   |  that indicates when and how costs of other data types are
   |  signaled.

   The present document extends the definition of a legacy cost map
   given in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] to allow a cost entry to be an array of values,
   with one value per time interval, instead of being just one number,
   when the Cost Calendar functionality is activated on this cost.
   Therefore, the implementor of this extension MUST consider that a
   cost entry is an array of values if this cost has been queried as a
   Calendar.

   Specifically, an implementation of this extension MUST parse the
   &quot;number-of-intervals&quot; attribute of the Calendar attributes in an IRD
   entry announcing a service providing a Cost Calendar for a given cost
   type.  The implementation then will know that a cost entry of the
   service will be an array of values, and the expected size of the
   array is that specified by the &quot;number-of-intervals&quot; attribute.  The
   following rules attempt to ensure consistency between the array size
   announced by the Server and the actual size of the array received by
   the Client:

   *  The size of the array of values conveyed in a Cost Calendar and
      received by the Client MUST be equal to the value of attribute
      &quot;number-of-intervals&quot; indicated in the IRD for the requested cost
      type.

   *  When the size of the array received by the Client is different
      from the expected size, the Client SHOULD ignore the received
      array.

   To realize an ALTO Calendar, this document extends the IRD and the
   ALTO requests and responses for Cost Calendars.

   This extension is designed to be lightweight and to ensure backwards
   compatibility with base protocol ALTO Clients and with other
   extensions.  It relies on &quot;Parsing of Unknown Fields&quot; (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-8.3.7">Section&nbsp;8.3.7
   of [RFC7285]</a>), which states: &quot;Extensions may include additional
   fields within JSON objects defined in this document.  ALTO
   implementations MUST ignore unknown fields when processing ALTO
   messages.&quot;

   The Calendar-specific capabilities are integrated in the information
   resources of the IRD and in the &quot;meta&quot; member of ALTO responses to
   Cost Calendars requests.  A Calendar and its capabilities are
   associated with a given information resource and within this
   information resource with a given cost type.  This design has several
   advantages:

   *  it does not introduce a new mode,

   *  it does not introduce new media types, and

   *  it allows an ALTO Server to offer, for a cost type, different
      Calendars with attributes that are specific to the information
      resources providing a Calendar for this cost type, instead of
      being globally specific to the cost type.

   The applicable Calendared information resources are:

   *  the Filtered Cost Map and

   *  the Endpoint Cost Map.

   The ALTO Server can choose in which frequency it provides cost
   Calendars to ALTO Clients.  It may either provide Calendar updates
   starting at the request date or carefully schedule its updates so as
   to take profit from a potential repetition/periodicity of Calendar
   values.

   Since Calendar attributes are specific to an information resource, a
   Server may adapt the granularity of the calendared information so as
   to moderate the volume of exchanged data.  For example, suppose a
   Server provides a Calendar for cost type name &quot;routingcost&quot;.  The
   Server may offer a Calendar in a Cost Map resource, which may be a
   voluminous resource, as an array of 6 intervals lasting each 4 hours.
   It may also offer a Calendar in an Endpoint Cost Map resource, which
   is potentially less voluminous, as a finer-grained array of 24
   intervals lasting 1 hour each.

   The ALTO Server does not support constraints on Calendars, provided
   Calendars are requested for numerical values, for two main reasons:

   *  Constraints on an array of values may be various.  For instance,
      some Clients may refuse Calendars with one single value violating
      a constraint, whereas other ones may tolerate Calendars with
      values violating constraints, for example, at given times.
      Therefore, expressing constraints in a way that covers all
      possible Client preferences is challenging.

   *  If constraints were to be supported, the processing overhead would
      be substantial for the Server as it would have to parse all the
      values of the Calendar array before returning a response.

   As providing the constraint functionality in conjunction with the
   Calendar functionality is not feasible for the reasons described
   above, the two features are mutually exclusive.  The absence of
   constraints on Filtered Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Map Calendars
   reflects a divergence from the non-calendared information resources
   defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] and extended in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>], which support
   optional constraints.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.1" href="#section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  ALTO Cost Calendar for All Cost Modes</span>

   An ALTO Cost Calendar is well suited for values encoded in the
   &quot;numerical&quot; mode.  Actually, a Calendar can also represent metrics in
   other modes considered as compatible with time-varying values.  For
   example, types of cost values (such as JSONBool) can also be
   calendared (as their value may be &#x27;true&#x27; or &#x27;false&#x27; depending on
   given time periods or likewise) values represented by strings, such
   as &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, &quot;low&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, and &quot;open&quot;.

   Note also that a Calendar is suitable as well for time-varying
   metrics provided in the &quot;ordinal&quot; mode if these values are time-
   varying and the ALTO Server provides updates of cost-value-based
   preferences.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.2" href="#section-3.3.2">3.3.2</a>.  Compatibility with Legacy ALTO Clients</span>

   The ALTO protocol extensions for Cost Calendars have been defined so
   as to ensure that Calendar-capable ALTO Servers can provide legacy
   ALTO Clients with legacy information resources as well.  That is, a
   legacy ALTO Client can request resources and receive responses as
   specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

   A Calendar-aware ALTO Server MUST implement the base protocol
   specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

   A Calendar-aware ALTO Client MUST implement the base protocol
   specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

   As a consequence, when a metric is available as a Calendar array, it
   also MUST be available as a single value, as required by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].
   The Server, in this case, provides the current value of the metric to
   either Calendar-aware Clients not interested in future or time-based
   values or Clients implementing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] only.

   For compatibility with legacy ALTO Clients specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>],
   calendared information resources are not applicable for full cost
   maps for the following reason: a legacy ALTO Client would receive a
   calendared cost map via an HTTP &#x27;GET&#x27; command.  As specified in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-8.3.7">Section&nbsp;8.3.7 of [RFC7285]</a>, it will ignore the Calendar attributes
   indicated in the &quot;meta&quot; of the responses.  Therefore, lacking
   information on Calendar attributes, it will not be able to correctly
   interpret and process the values of the received array of Calendar
   cost values.

   Therefore, calendared information resources MUST be requested via the
   Filtered Cost Map Service or the Endpoint Cost Service using a POST
   method.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  ALTO Calendar Specification: IRD Extensions</span>

   The Calendar attributes in the IRD information resources capabilities
   carry dateless values.  A Calendar is associated with an information
   resource rather than a cost type.  For example, a Server can provide
   a &quot;routingcost&quot; Calendar for the Filtered Cost Map Service at a
   granularity of one day and a &quot;routingcost&quot; Calendar for the Endpoint
   Cost Service at a finer granularity but for a limited number of
   endpoints.  An example IRD with Calendar-specific features is
   provided in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Calendar Attributes in the IRD Resource Capabilities</span>

   A Cost Calendar for a given cost type MUST be indicated in the IRD by
   an object of type CalendarAttributes.  A CalendarAttributes object is
   represented by the &quot;calendar-attributes&quot; member of a resource entry.
   Member &quot;calendar-attributes&quot; is an array of CalendarAttributes
   objects.  Each CalendarAttributes object lists a set of one or more
   cost types it applies to.  A cost type name MUST NOT appear more than
   once in the &quot;calendar-attributes&quot; member of a resource entry;
   multiple appearances of a cost type name in the CalendarAttributes
   object of the &quot;calendar-attributes&quot; member MUST cause the ALTO Client
   to ignore any occurrences of this name beyond the first encountered
   occurrence.  The Client SHOULD consider the CalendarAttributes object
   in the array containing the first encountered occurrence of a cost
   type as the valid one for this cost type.  As an alternative, the
   Client may want to avoid the risks of erroneous guidance associated
   to the use of potentially invalid Calendar values.  In this case, the
   Client MAY ignore the totality of occurrences of CalendarAttributes
   objects containing the cost type name and query the cost type using
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

   The encoding format for object CalendarAttributes using JSON
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>] is as follows:

   CalendarAttributes calendar-attributes &lt;1..*&gt;;

   object{
     JSONString cost-type-names &lt;1..*&gt;;
     JSONNumber time-interval-size;
     JSONNumber number-of-intervals;
   } CalendarAttributes;

   &quot;cost-type-names&quot;:
      An array of one or more elements indicating the cost type names in
      the IRD entry to which the values of &quot;time-interval-size&quot; and
      &quot;number-of-intervals&quot; apply.

   &quot;time-interval-size&quot;:
      The duration of an ALTO Calendar time interval in a unit of
      seconds.  A &quot;time-interval-size&quot; value contains a non-negative
      JSONNumber.  Example values are 300 and 7200, meaning that each
      Calendar value applies on a time interval that lasts 5 minutes and
      2 hours, respectively.  Since an interval size (e.g., 100 ms) can
      be smaller than the unit, the value specified may be a floating
      point (e.g., 0.1).  Both ALTO Clients and Servers should be aware
      of potential precision issues caused by using floating point
      numbers; for example, the floating number 0.1 cannot be
      represented precisely using a finite number of binary bits.  To
      improve interoperability and be consistent with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] on the
      use of floating point numbers, the Server and the Client SHOULD
      use IEEE 754 double-precision floating point [<a href="#ref-IEEE.754.2019">IEEE.754.2019</a>] to
      store this value.

   &quot;number-of-intervals&quot;:
      A strictly positive integer (greater or equal to 1) that indicates
      the number of values of the Cost Calendar array.

   *  An ALTO Server SHOULD specify the &quot;time-interval-size&quot; in the IRD
      as the smallest it is able to provide.  A Client that needs a
      longer interval can aggregate multiple cost values to obtain it.

   *  Attribute &quot;cost-type-names&quot; is associated with &quot;time-interval-
      size&quot; and &quot;number-of-intervals&quot;, because multiple cost types may
      share the same values for attributes &quot;time-interval-size&quot; and
      &quot;number-of-intervals&quot;.  To avoid redundancies, cost type names
      sharing the same values for &quot;time-interval-size&quot; and &quot;number-of-
      intervals&quot; are grouped in the &quot;cost-type-names&quot; attribute.  In the
      example IRD provided in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>, the information resource
      &quot;filtered-cost-map-calendar&quot; provides a Calendar for cost type
      names &quot;num-routingcost&quot;, &quot;num-throughputrating&quot;, and &quot;string-
      servicestatus&quot;.  Cost type names &quot;num-routingcost&quot; and &quot;num-
      throughputrating&quot; are grouped in the &quot;cost-type-names&quot; attribute
      because they share the same values for &quot;time-interval-size&quot; and
      &quot;number-of-intervals&quot;, which are respectively 7200 and 12.

   *  Multiplying &quot;time-interval-size&quot; by &quot;number-of-intervals&quot; provides
      the duration of the provided Calendar.  For example, an ALTO
      Server may provide a Calendar for ALTO values changing every
      &quot;time-interval-size&quot; equal to 5 minutes.  If &quot;number-of-intervals&quot;
      has the value 12, then the duration of the provided Calendar is 1
      hour.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Calendars in a Delegate IRD</span>

   It may be useful to distinguish IRD resources supported by the base
   ALTO protocol from resources supported by its extensions.  To achieve
   this, one option is that a &quot;root&quot; ALTO Server implementing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>]
   resources and running at a given domain delegates &quot;specialized&quot;
   information resources, such as the ones providing Cost Calendars, to
   another ALTO Server running in a subdomain.  The &quot;root&quot; ALTO Server
   can provide a Calendar-specific resource entry that has a media-type
   of &quot;application/alto-directory+json&quot; and that specifies the URI
   allowing to retrieve the location of a Calendar-aware Server and
   discover its resources.  This option is described in &quot;Delegation
   Using IRD&quot; (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-9.2.4">Section&nbsp;9.2.4 of [RFC7285]</a>).

   This document provides an example where a &quot;root&quot; ALTO Server runs in
   a domain called &quot;alto.example.com&quot;.  It delegates the announcement of
   Calendars capabilities to an ALTO Server running in a subdomain
   called &quot;custom.alto.example.com&quot;.  The location of the &quot;delegate
   Calendar IRD&quot; is assumed to be indicated in the &quot;root&quot; IRD by the
   resource entry: &quot;custom-calendared-resources&quot;.

   Another benefit of delegation is that some cost types for some
   resources may be more advantageous as Cost Calendars, and it makes
   little sense to get them as a single value.  For example, if a cost
   type has predictable and frequently changing values calendared in
   short time intervals, such as a minute, it saves time and network
   resources to track the cost values via a focused delegate Server
   rather than the more general &quot;root&quot; Server.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Example IRD with ALTO Cost Calendars</span>

   This section provides an example ALTO Server IRD that supports
   various cost metrics and cost modes.  In particular, since [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>]
   makes it mandatory, the Server uses metric &quot;routingcost&quot; in the
   &quot;numerical&quot; mode.

   For illustrative purposes, this section introduces 3 other fictitious
   example metrics and modes that should be understood as examples and
   should not be used or considered as normative.

   The cost type names used in the example IRD are as follows:

   &quot;num-routingcost&quot;:
      Refers to metric &quot;routingcost&quot; in the numerical mode, as defined
      in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] and registered with IANA.

   &quot;num-owdelay&quot;:
      Refers to fictitious performance metric &quot;owdelay&quot; in the
      &quot;numerical&quot; mode to reflect the one-way packet transmission delay
      on a path.  A related performance metric is currently under
      definition in [<a href="#ref-ALTO_METRICS">ALTO_METRICS</a>].

   &quot;num-throughputrating&quot;:
      Refers to fictitious metric &quot;throughputrating&quot; in the &quot;numerical&quot;
      mode to reflect the provider preference in terms of end-to-end
      throughput.

   &quot;string-servicestatus&quot;:
      Refers to fictitious metric &quot;servicestatus&quot; containing a string to
      reflect the availability, defined by the provider, of, for
      instance, path connectivity.

   The example IRD includes 2 particular URIs providing Calendars:

   &quot;https://custom.alto.example.com/calendar/costmap/filtered&quot;:
      A Filtered Cost Map in which Calendar capabilities are indicated
      for cost type names &quot;num-routingcost&quot;, &quot;num-throughputrating&quot;, and
      &quot;string-servicestatus&quot; and

   &quot;https://custom.alto.example.com/calendar/endpointcost/lookup&quot;:
      An Endpoint Cost Map in which Calendar capabilities are indicated
      for cost type names &quot;num-routingcost&quot;, &quot;num-owdelay&quot;, &quot;num-
      throughputrating&quot;, and &quot;string-servicestatus&quot;.

   The design of the Calendar capabilities allows some Calendars with
   the same cost type name to be available in several information
   resources with different Calendar attributes.  This is the case for
   Calendars on &quot;num-routingcost&quot;, &quot;num-throughputrating&quot;, and &quot;string-
   servicestatus&quot;, available in both the Filtered Cost Map and Endpoint
   Cost Service but with different time interval sizes for &quot;num-
   throughputrating&quot; and &quot;string-servicestatus&quot;.

   In this example IRD, for the Filtered Cost Map Service:

   *  the Calendar for &quot;num-routingcost&quot; and &quot;num-throughputrating&quot; is
      an array of 12 values, each provided on a time interval lasting
      7200 seconds (2 hours) and

   *  the Calendar for &quot;string-servicestatus&quot; is an array of 48 values,
      each provided on a time interval lasting 1800 seconds (30
      minutes).

   For the Endpoint Cost Service:

   *  the Calendar for &quot;num-routingcost&quot; is an array of 24 values, each
      provided on a time interval lasting 3600 seconds (1 hour),

   *  the Calendar for &quot;num-owdelay&quot; is an array of 12 values, each
      provided on a time interval lasting 300 seconds (5 minutes),

   *  the Calendar for &quot;num-throughputrating&quot; is an array of 60 values,
      each provided on a time interval lasting 60 seconds (1 minute),
      and

   *  the Calendar for &quot;string-servicestatus&quot; is an array of 30 values,
      each provided on a time interval lasting 120 seconds (2 minutes).

   Note that in this example IRD, member &quot;cost-constraints&quot; is present
   with a value set to &quot;true&quot; in both information resources &quot;filtered-
   cost-map-calendar&quot; and &quot;endpoint-cost-map-calendar&quot;.  Although a
   Calendar-aware ALTO Server does not support constraints for the
   reasons explained in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>, it MUST support constraints on cost
   types that are not requested as Calendars but are requested as
   specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  ALTO Calendar Specification: Service Information Resources</span>

   This section documents extensions to two basic ALTO information
   resources (Filtered Cost Maps and Endpoint Cost Service) to provide
   calendared information services for them.

   Both extensions return calendar start time (calendar-start-time, a
   point in time), which MUST be specified as an HTTP &quot;Date&quot; header
   field using the IMF-fixdate format specified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1">Section&nbsp;7.1.1.1 of
   [RFC7231]</a>.  Note that the IMF-fixdate format uses &quot;GMT&quot;, not &quot;UTC&quot;,
   to designate the time zone, as in this example:

                    Date: Tue, 15 Nov 2019 08:12:31 GMT

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Calendar Extensions for Filtered Cost Maps (FCM)</span>

   A legacy ALTO Client requests and gets Filtered Cost Map responses,
   as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.1" href="#section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  Calendar Extensions in Filtered Cost Map Requests</span>

   The input parameters of a &quot;legacy&quot; request for a Filtered Cost Map,
   defined by object ReqFilteredCostMap in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-11.3.2">Section&nbsp;11.3.2 of [RFC7285]</a>,
   are augmented with one additional member.  The same augmentation
   applies to object ReqFilteredCostMap defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8189#section-4.1.2">Section&nbsp;4.1.2 of
   [RFC8189]</a>.

   A Calendar-aware ALTO Client requesting a Calendar on a given cost
   type for a Filtered Cost Map resource having Calendar capabilities
   MUST add the following field to its input parameters:

                          JSONBoolean calendared&lt;1..*&gt;;

   This field is an array of 1 to N boolean values, where N is the
   number of requested metrics.  N is greater than 1 when the Client and
   the Server also implement [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>].

   Each entry corresponds to the requested metric at the same array
   position.  Each boolean value indicates whether or not the ALTO
   Server should provide the values for this cost type as a Calendar.
   The array MUST contain exactly N boolean values, otherwise, the
   Server returns an error.

   This field MUST NOT be included if no member &quot;calendar-attributes&quot; is
   specified in this information resource.

   If a value of field &quot;calendared&quot; is &#x27;true&#x27; for a cost type name for
   which no Calendar attributes have been specified, an ALTO Server,
   whether it implements the extensions of this document or only
   implements [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>], MUST ignore it and return a response with a
   single cost value, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

   If this field is not present, it MUST be assumed to have only values
   equal to &#x27;false&#x27;.

   A Calendar-aware ALTO Client that supports requests for only one cost
   type at a time and wants to request a Calendar MUST provide an array
   of 1 element:

                          &quot;calendared&quot; : [true],

   A Calendar-aware ALTO Client that supports requests for more than one
   cost type at a time, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>], MUST provide an array
   of N values set to &#x27;true&#x27; or &#x27;false&#x27;, depending whether it wants the
   applicable cost type values as a single or calendared value.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.2" href="#section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>.  Calendar Extensions in Filtered Cost Map Responses</span>

   In a calendared ALTO Filtered Cost Map, a cost value between a source
   and a destination is a JSON array of JSON values.  An ALTO Calendar
   values array has a number of values equal to the value of member
   &quot;number-of-intervals&quot; of the Calendar attributes that are indicated
   in the IRD.  These attributes will be conveyed as metadata in the
   Filtered Cost Map response.  Each element of the array is valid for
   the time interval that matches its array position.

   The FCM response conveys metadata, among which:

   *  some are not specific to Calendars and ensure compatibility with
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>] and

   *  some are specific to Calendars.

   The non-Calendar-specific &quot;meta&quot; fields of a calendared Filtered Cost
   Map response MUST include at least:

   *  if the ALTO Client requests cost values for one cost type at a
      time, only the &quot;meta&quot; fields specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] for these
      information service responses:

      -  &quot;dependent-vtags&quot; and

      -  &quot;cost-type&quot; field.

   *  if the ALTO Client implements the Multi-Cost ALTO extension
      specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>] and requests cost values for several cost
      types at a time, the &quot;meta&quot; fields specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>] for
      these information service responses:

      -  &quot;dependent-vtags&quot;,

      -  &quot;cost-type&quot; field with value set to &#x27;{}&#x27;, for backwards
         compatibility with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>], and

      -  &quot;multi-cost-types&quot; field.

   If the Client request does not provide member &quot;calendared&quot; or if it
   provides it with a value equal to &#x27;false&#x27; for all the requested cost
   types, then the ALTO Server response is exactly as specified in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>].

   If the value of member &quot;calendared&quot; is equal to &#x27;false&#x27; for a given
   requested cost type, the ALTO Server MUST return, for this cost type,
   a single cost value as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

   If the value of member &quot;calendared&quot; is equal to &#x27;true&#x27; for a given
   requested cost type, the ALTO Server returns, for this cost type, a
   cost value Calendar, as specified above in this section.  In addition
   to the above cited non-Calendar-specific &quot;meta&quot; members, the Server
   MUST provide a Calendar-specific metadata field.

   The Calendar-specific &quot;meta&quot; field that a calendared Filtered Cost
   Map response MUST include is a member called &quot;calendar-response-
   attributes&quot;, which describes properties of the Calendar and where:

   *  member &quot;calendar-response-attributes&quot; is an array of one or more
      objects of type &quot;CalendarResponseAttributes&quot;,

   *  each &quot;CalendarResponseAttributes&quot; object in the array is specified
      for one or more cost types for which the value of member
      &quot;calendared&quot;, in object ReqFilteredCostMap provided in the Client
      request, is equal to &#x27;true&#x27; and for which a Calendar is provided
      for the requested information resource, and

   *  the &quot;CalendarResponseAttributes&quot; object that applies to a cost
      type name has a corresponding &quot;CalendarAttributes&quot; object defined
      for this cost type name in the IRD capabilities of the requested
      information resource.  This object is the entry in the &quot;calendar-
      attributes&quot; array member of the IRD resource entry, which includes
      the name of the requested cost type.  This corresponding
      &quot;CalendarAttributes&quot; object has the same values as object
      &quot;CalendarResponseAttributes&quot; for members &quot;time-interval-size&quot; and
      &quot;number-of-intervals&quot;.  The members of the
      &quot;CalendarResponseAttributes&quot; object include all the members of the
      corresponding &quot;CalendarAttributes&quot; object.

   The format of member &quot;CalendarResponseAttributes is defined as
   follows:

   CalendarResponseAttributes calendar-response-attributes &lt;1..*&gt;;

   object{
     [JSONString cost-type-names &lt;1..*&gt;;]
     JSONString calendar-start-time;
     JSONNumber time-interval-size;
     JSONNumber number-of-intervals;
     [JSONNumber repeated;]
   } CalendarResponseAttributes;

   Object CalendarResponseAttributes has the following attributes:

   &quot;cost-type-names&quot;:
      An array of one or more cost type names to which the value of the
      other members of CalendarResponseAttributes apply and for which a
      Calendar has been requested.  The value of this member is a subset
      of the &quot;cost-type-names&quot; member of the abovementioned
      corresponding &quot;CalendarAttributes&quot; object in the &quot;calendar-
      attributes&quot; array member in the IRD.  This member MUST be present
      when Cost Calendars are provided for more than one cost type.

   &quot;calendar-start-time&quot;:
      Indicates the date at which the first value of the Calendar
      applies.  The value is a string that, as specified in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>,
      contains an HTTP &quot;Date&quot; header field using the IMF-fixdate format
      specified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1">Section&nbsp;7.1.1.1 of [RFC7231]</a>.  The value provided for
      attribute &quot;calendar-start-time&quot; SHOULD NOT be later than the
      request date.

   &quot;time-interval-size&quot;:
      As specified in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> and with the same value as in the
      abovementioned corresponding &quot;CalendarAttributes&quot; object.

   &quot;number-of-intervals&quot;:
      As specified in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> and with the same value as in the
      abovementioned corresponding &quot;CalendarAttributes&quot; object.

   &quot;repeated&quot;:
      An optional field provided for Calendars.  It is an integer N
      greater or equal to &#x27;1&#x27; that indicates how many iterations of the
      Calendar value array starting at the date indicated by &quot;calendar-
      start-time&quot; have the same values.  The number N includes the
      iteration provided in the returned response.

   For example, suppose the &quot;calendar-start-time&quot; member has value &quot;Mon,
   30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT&quot;, the &quot;time-interval-size&quot; member has value
   &#x27;3600&#x27;, the &quot;number-of-intervals&quot; member has value &#x27;24&#x27;, and the
   value of member &quot;repeated&quot; is equal to &#x27;4&#x27;.  This means that the
   Calendar values are the same on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
   Thursday on a period of 24 hours starting at 00:00:00 GMT.  The ALTO
   Client thus may use the same Calendar for the next 4 days starting at
   &quot;calendar-start-time&quot; and will only need to request a new one for
   Friday, July 4th at 00:00:00 GMT.

   Attribute &quot;repeated&quot; may take a very high value if a Calendar
   represents a cyclic value pattern that the Server considers valid for
   a long period and hence will only update once this period has elapsed
   or if an unexpected event occurs on the network.  In the latter case,
   the Client will be notified if it uses the &quot;ALTO Incremental Updates
   Using Server-Sent Events (SSE)&quot; Service, specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8895" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Incremental Updates Using Server-Sent Events (SSE)&quot;">RFC8895</a>].  To
   this end, it is RECOMMENDED that ALTO Servers providing ALTO
   Calendars also provide the &quot;ALTO Incremental Updates Using Server-
   Sent Events (SSE)&quot; Service, which is specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8895" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Incremental Updates Using Server-Sent Events (SSE)&quot;">RFC8895</a>].
   Likewise, ALTO Clients capable of using ALTO Calendars SHOULD also
   use the SSE Service.  See also discussion in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> &quot;Operational
   Considerations&quot;.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.3" href="#section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a>.  Use Case and Example: FCM with a Bandwidth Calendar</span>

   An example of non-real-time information that can be provisioned in a
   Calendar is the expected path throughput.  While the transmission
   rate can be measured in real time by end systems, the operator of a
   data center is in the position of formulating preferences for given
   paths at given time periods to avoid traffic peaks due to diurnal
   usage patterns.  In this example, we assume that an ALTO Client
   requests a Calendar of network-provider-defined throughput ratings as
   specified in the IRD to schedule its bulk data transfers as described
   in the use cases.

   In the example IRD, Calendars for cost type name &quot;num-
   throughputrating&quot; are available for the information resources
   &quot;filtered-cost-calendar-map&quot; and &quot;endpoint-cost-map-calendar&quot;.  The
   ALTO Client requests a Calendar for &quot;num-throughputrating&quot; via a POST
   request for a Filtered Cost Map.

   We suppose in the present example that the ALTO Client sends its
   request on Tuesday, July 1st 2019 at 13:15.  The Server returns
   Calendars with arrays of 12 numbers for each source and destination
   pair.  The values for metric &quot;throughputrating&quot;, in this example, are
   assumed to be encoded in 2 digits.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Calendar Extensions in the Endpoint Cost Service</span>

   This document extends the Endpoint Cost Service, as defined in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-11.5.1">Section&nbsp;11.5.1 of [RFC7285]</a>, by adding new input parameters and
   capabilities and by returning JSONArrays instead of JSONNumbers as
   the cost values.  The media type (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-11.5.1.1">Section&nbsp;11.5.1.1 of [RFC7285]</a>) and
   HTTP method (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-11.5.1.2">Section&nbsp;11.5.1.2 of [RFC7285]</a>) are unchanged.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.1" href="#section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  Calendar-Specific Input in Endpoint Cost Requests</span>

   The extensions to the requests for calendared Endpoint Cost Maps are
   the same as for the Filtered Cost Map Service, specified in
   <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a> of this document.  Likewise, the rules defined around
   the extensions to ECM requests are the same as those defined in
   <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a> for FCM requests.

   The ReqEndpointCostMap object for a calendared ECM request will have
   the following format:

   object {
     [CostType cost-type;]
     [CostType multi-cost-types&lt;1..*&gt;;]
     [JSONBoolean calendared&lt;1..*&gt;;]
     EndpointFilter endpoints;
   } ReqEndpointCostMap;

   object {
     [TypedEndpointAddr srcs&lt;0..*&gt;;]
     [TypedEndpointAddr dsts&lt;0..*&gt;;]
   } EndpointFilter;

   Member &quot;cost-type&quot; is optional because, in the ReqEndpointCostMap
   object definition of this document, it is jointly present with member
   &quot;multi-cost-types&quot; to ensure compatibility with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>].  In
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>], members &quot;cost-type&quot; and &quot;multi-cost-types&quot; are both
   optional and have to obey the rule specified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8189#section-4.1.2">Section&nbsp;4.1.2 of
   [RFC8189]</a> stating that &quot;the Client MUST specify either &quot;cost-type&quot; or
   &quot;multi-cost-types&quot; but MUST NOT specify both&quot;.

   The interpretation of member &quot;calendared&quot; is the same as for the
   ReqFilteredCostMap object defined in <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a> of this document.
   The interpretation of the other members is the same as for object
   ReqEndpointCostMap defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>].  The type
   TypedEndpointAddr is defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-10.4.1">Section&nbsp;10.4.1 of [RFC7285]</a>.

   For the reasons explained in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>, a Calendar-aware ALTO
   Server does not support constraints.  Therefore, member
   &quot;[constraints]&quot; is not present in the ReqEndpointCostMap object, and
   member &quot;constraints&quot; MUST NOT be present in the input parameters of a
   request for an Endpoint Cost Calendar.  If this member is present,
   the Server MUST ignore it.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.2" href="#section-5.2.2">5.2.2</a>.  Calendar Attributes in the Endpoint Cost Response</span>

   The &quot;meta&quot; field of a calendared Endpoint Cost response MUST include
   at least:

   *  if the ALTO Client supports cost values for one cost type at a
      time only, the &quot;meta&quot; fields specified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-11.5.1.6">Section&nbsp;11.5.1.6 of
      [RFC7285]</a> for the Endpoint Cost response:

      -  &quot;cost-type&quot; field.

   *  if the ALTO Client supports cost values for several cost types at
      a time, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>], the &quot;meta&quot; fields specified in
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>] for the Endpoint Cost response:

      -  &quot;cost-type&quot; field with value set to &#x27;{}&#x27;, for backwards
         compatibility with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

      -  &quot;multi-cost-types&quot; field.

   If the Client request does not provide member &quot;calendared&quot; or if it
   provides it with a value equal to &#x27;false&#x27;, for all the requested cost
   types, then the ALTO Server response is exactly as specified in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>].

   If the ALTO Client provides member &quot;calendared&quot; in the input
   parameters with a value equal to &#x27;true&#x27; for given requested cost
   types, the &quot;meta&quot; member of a calendared Endpoint Cost response MUST
   include, for these cost types, an additional member &quot;calendar-
   response-attributes&quot;, the contents of which obey the same rules as
   for the Filtered Cost Map Service, specified in <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>.  The
   Server response is thus changed as follows, with respect to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>]
   and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>]:

   *  the &quot;meta&quot; member has one additional field
      &quot;CalendarResponseAttributes&quot;, as specified for the Filtered Cost
      Map Service, and

   *  the calendared costs are JSONArrays instead of the JSONNumbers
      format used by legacy ALTO implementations.  All arrays have a
      number of values equal to &#x27;number-of-intervals&#x27;.  Each value
      corresponds to the cost in that interval.

   If the value of member &quot;calendared&quot; is equal to &#x27;false&#x27; for a given
   requested cost type, the ALTO Server MUST return, for this cost type,
   a single cost value as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.3" href="#section-5.2.3">5.2.3</a>.  Use Case and Example: ECS with a routingcost Calendar</span>

   Let us assume an Application Client is located in an end system with
   limited resources and has access to the network that is either
   intermittent or provides an acceptable quality in limited but
   predictable time periods.  Therefore, it needs to schedule both its
   resource-greedy networking activities and its ALTO transactions.

   The Application Client has the choice to trade content or resources
   with a set of endpoints and needs to decide with which one it will
   connect and at what time.  For instance, the endpoints are spread in
   different time zones or have intermittent access.  In this example,
   the &#x27;routingcost&#x27; is assumed to be time-varying, with values provided
   as ALTO Calendars.

   The ALTO Client associated with the Application Client queries an
   ALTO Calendar on &#x27;routingcost&#x27; and will get the Calendar covering the
   24-hour time period &quot;containing&quot; the date and time of the ALTO Client
   request.

   For cost type &quot;num-routingcost&quot;, the solicited ALTO Server has
   defined 3 different daily patterns, each represented by a Calendar to
   cover the week of Monday, June 30th at 00:00 to Sunday, July 6th
   23:59:

   *  C1 for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (weekdays)

   *  C2 for Saturday and Sunday (weekends)

   *  C3 for Friday (maintenance outage on July 4, 2019 from 02:00:00
      GMT to 04:00:00 GMT or a big holiday that is widely celebrated and
      generates a large number of connections).

   In the following example, the ALTO Client sends its request on
   Tuesday, July 1st 2019 at 13:15.

   The &quot;routingcost&quot; values are assumed to be encoded in 3 digits.

   When the Client gets the Calendar for &quot;routingcost&quot;, it sees that the
   &quot;calendar-start-time&quot; is Monday at 00h00 GMT and member &quot;repeated&quot; is
   equal to &#x27;4&#x27;.  It understands that the provided values are valid
   until Thursday and will only need to get a Calendar update on Friday.

<span class="h4">        routingcost and owdelay</span>

   In this example, it is assumed that the ALTO Server implements multi-
   cost capabilities, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8189" title="&quot;Multi-Cost Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)&quot;">RFC8189</a>] . That is, an ALTO
   Client can request and receive values for several cost types in one
   single transaction.  An illustrating use case is a path selection
   done on the basis of 2 metrics: routingcost and owdelay.

   As in the previous example, the IRD indicates that the ALTO Server
   provides &quot;routingcost&quot; Calendars in terms of 24 time intervals of 1
   hour (3600 seconds) each.

   For metric &quot;owdelay&quot;, the IRD indicates that the ALTO Server provides
   Calendars in terms of 12 time interval values lasting 5 minutes (300
   seconds) each.

   In the following example transaction, the ALTO Client sends its
   request on Tuesday, July 1st 2019 at 13:15.

   This example assumes that the values of metric &quot;owdelay&quot; and
   &quot;routingcost&quot; are encoded in 3 digits.

       }
     }
   }

   When receiving the response, the Client sees that the Calendar values
   for metric &quot;routingcost&quot; are repeated for 4 iterations.  Therefore,
   in its next requests until the &quot;routingcost&quot; Calendar is expected to
   change, the Client will only need to request a Calendar for
   &quot;owdelay&quot;.

   Without the ALTO Calendar extensions, the ALTO Client would have no
   clue on the dynamicity of the metric value change and would spend
   needless time requesting values at an inappropriate pace.  In
   addition, without the Multi-Cost ALTO capabilities, the ALTO Client
   would duplicate this waste of time as it would need to send one
   request per cost metric.

   security considerations (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-15">Section&nbsp;15 of [RFC7285]</a>) fully apply when
   this extension is provided by an ALTO Server.  For example, the same
   authenticity and integrity considerations (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-15.1">Section&nbsp;15.1 of [RFC7285]</a>)
   still fully apply; the same considerations for the privacy of ALTO
   users (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-15.4">Section&nbsp;15.4 of [RFC7285]</a>) also still fully apply.

   The calendaring information provided by this extension requires
   additional considerations on three security considerations discussed
   in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>]: potential undesirable guidance to Clients (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-15.2">Section&nbsp;15.2
   of [RFC7285]</a>), confidentiality of ALTO information (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-15.3">Section&nbsp;15.3 of
   [RFC7285]</a>), and availability of ALTO (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-15.5">Section&nbsp;15.5 of [RFC7285]</a>).
   For example, by providing network information in the future in a
   Calendar, this extension may improve availability of ALTO when the
   ALTO Server is unavailable but related information is already
   provided in the Calendar.

   For confidentiality of ALTO information, an operator should be
   cognizant that this extension may introduce a new risk, a malicious
   ALTO Client may get information for future events that are scheduled
   through Calendaring.  Possessing such information, the malicious
   Client may use it to generate massive connections to the network at
   times where its load is expected to be high.

   To mitigate this risk, the operator should address the risk of ALTO
   information being leaked to malicious Clients or third parties.  As
   specified in &quot;Protection Strategies&quot; (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-15.3.2">Section&nbsp;15.3.2 of [RFC7285]</a>),
   the ALTO Server should authenticate ALTO Clients and use the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol so that man-in-the-middle
   (MITM) attacks to intercept an ALTO Calendar are not possible.
   &quot;Authentication and Encryption&quot; (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-8.3.5">Section&nbsp;8.3.5 of [RFC7285]</a>) ensures
   the availability of such a solution.  It specifies that &quot;ALTO Server
   implementations as well as ALTO Client implementations MUST support
   the &quot;https&quot; URI scheme of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2818" title="&quot;HTTP Over TLS&quot;">RFC2818</a>] and Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5246" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2&quot;">RFC5246</a>]&quot;.

   <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> of TLS 1.3 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8446" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">RFC8446</a>] states: &quot;While TLS 1.3 is not directly
   compatible with previous versions, all versions of TLS incorporate a
   versioning mechanism which allows Clients and Servers to
   interoperably negotiate a common version if one is supported by both
   peers&quot;.  ALTO Clients and Servers SHOULD support both TLS 1.3
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8446" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">RFC8446</a>] and TLS 1.2 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5246" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2&quot;">RFC5246</a>] and MAY support and use newer
   versions of TLS as long as the negotiation process succeeds.

   The operator should be cognizant that the preceding mechanisms do not
   address all security risks.  In particular, they will not help in the
   case of &quot;malicious Clients&quot; possessing valid authentication
   credentials.  The threat here is that legitimate Clients have become
   subverted by an attacker and are now &#x27;bots&#x27; being asked to
   participate in a DDoS attack.  The Calendar information now becomes
   valuable in knowing exactly when to perpetrate a DDoS attack.  A
   mechanism, such as a monitoring system that detects abnormal
   behaviors, may still be needed.

   To avoid malicious or erroneous guidance from ALTO information, an
   ALTO Client should be cognizant that using calendaring information
   can have risks: (1) Calendar values, especially in &quot;repeated&quot;
   Calendars, may be only statistical and (2) future events may change.
   Hence, a more robust ALTO Client should adapt and extend protection
   strategies specified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7285#section-15.2">Section&nbsp;15.2 of [RFC7285]</a>.  For example, to
   be notified immediately when a particular ALTO value that the Client
   depends on changes, it is RECOMMENDED that both the ALTO Client and
   ALTO Server using this extension support &quot;Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO) Incremental Updates Using Server-Sent Events
   (SSE)&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8895" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Incremental Updates Using Server-Sent Events (SSE)&quot;">RFC8895</a>].

   Another risk of erroneous guidance appears when the Server exposes an
   occurrence of a same cost type name in different elements of the
   Calendar objects array associated to an information resource.  In
   this case, there is no way for the Client to figure out which
   Calendar object in the array is valid.  The specification in this
   document recommends, in this case, that the Client uses the first
   encountered Calendar object occurrence containing the cost type name.
   However, the Client may want to avoid the risks of erroneous guidance
   associated to the use of potentially invalid Calendar values.  To
   this end, as an alternative to the recommendation in this document,
   the Client MAY ignore the totality of occurrences of
   CalendarAttributes objects containing the cost type name and query
   this cost type using [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Operational Considerations</span>

   It is important that both the operator of the network and the
   operator of the applications consider both the feedback aspect and
   the prediction-based (uncertainty) aspect of using the Cost Calendar.

   First, consider the feedback aspect and consider the Cost Calendar as
   a traffic-aware map service (e.g., Google Maps).  Using the service
   without considering its own effect, a large fleet can turn a not-
   congested road into a congested one; a large number of individual
   cars each choosing a road with light traffic (&quot;cheap link&quot;) can also
   result in congestion or result in a less-optimal global outcome
   (e.g., the Braess&#x27; Paradox [<a href="#ref-BRAESS_PARADOX">BRAESS_PARADOX</a>]).

   Next, consider the prediction aspect.  Conveying ALTO Cost Calendars
   tends to reduce the on-the-wire data exchange volume compared to
   multiple single-cost ALTO transactions.  An application using
   Calendars has a set of time-dependent values upon which it can plan
   its connections in advance with no need for the ALTO Client to query
   information at each time.  Additionally, the Calendar response
   attribute &quot;repeated&quot;, when provided, saves additional data exchanges
   in that it indicates that the ALTO Client does not need to query
   Calendars during a period indicated by this attribute.  The preceding
   is true only when &quot;accidents&quot; do not happen.

   Although individual network operators and application operators can
   choose their own approaches to address the aforementioned issues,
   this document recommends the following considerations.  First, a
   typical approach to reducing instability and handling uncertainty is
   to ensure timely update of information.  The SSE Service, as
   discussed in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>, can handle updates if supported by both the
   Server and the Client.  Second, when a network operator updates the
   Cost Calendar and when an application reacts to the update, they
   should consider the feedback effects.  This is the best approach even
   though there is theoretical analysis [<a href="#ref-SELFISH_RTG_2002">SELFISH_RTG_2002</a>] and Internet-
   based evaluation [<a href="#ref-SELFISH_RTG_2003">SELFISH_RTG_2003</a>] showing that uncoordinated
   behaviors do not always cause substantial suboptimal results.

   High-resolution intervals may be needed when values change, sometimes
   during very small time intervals but in a significant manner.  A way
   to avoid conveying too many entries is to leverage on the &quot;repeated&quot;
   feature.  A Server can smartly set the Calendar start time and number
   of intervals so as to declare them &quot;repeated&quot; for a large number of
   periods until the Calendar values change and are conveyed to
   requesting Clients.

   The newer JSON Data Interchange Format specification [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>] used
   in ALTO Calendars replaces the older one [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7159" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC7159</a>] used in the base
   ALTO protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7285" title="&quot;Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol&quot;">RFC7285</a>].  The newer JSON mandates UTF-8 text encoding
   to improve interoperability.  Therefore, ALTO Clients and Servers
   implementations using UTF-{16,32} need to be cognizant of the
   subsequent interoperability risks and MUST switch to UTF-8 encoding
   if they want to interoperate with Calendar-aware Servers and Clients.
