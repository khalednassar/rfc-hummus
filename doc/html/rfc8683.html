Abstract

   This document describes how Network Address and Protocol Translation
   from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64) (including 464XLAT) can be
   deployed in an IPv6 network -- whether it&#x27;s cellular ISP, broadband
   ISP, or enterprise -- and the possible optimizations.  This document
   also discusses issues to be considered when having IPv6-only
   connectivity, such as: a) DNS64, b) applications or devices that use
   literal IPv4 addresses or non-IPv6-compliant APIs, and c) IPv4-only
   hosts or applications.

   Stateful NAT64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6146" title="&quot;Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6146</a>] describes a stateful IPv6-to-IPv4
   translation mechanism that allows IPv6-only hosts to communicate with
   IPv4-only servers using unicast UDP, TCP, or ICMP by means of IPv4
   public address sharing among multiple IPv6-only hosts.  Unless
   otherwise stated, references to NAT64 (function) in this document
   should be interpreted as Stateful NAT64.

   The translation of the packet headers is done using the IP/ICMP
   translation algorithm defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7915" title="&quot;IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm&quot;">RFC7915</a>]; algorithmically
   translating the IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses, and vice versa, is
   done following [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6052" title="&quot;IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators&quot;">RFC6052</a>].

   DNS64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>] is in charge of the synthesis of AAAA records from
   the A records, so it only works for applications making use of DNS.
   It was designed to avoid changes in both the IPv6-only hosts and the
   IPv4-only server, so they can use a NAT64 function.  As discussed in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc6147#section-5.5">Section&nbsp;5.5 of [RFC6147]</a>, a security-aware and validating host has to
   perform the DNS64 function locally.

   However, the use of NAT64 and/or DNS64 presents three drawbacks:

   1.  Because DNS64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>] modifies DNS answers, and DNSSEC is
       designed to detect such modifications, DNS64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>] may
       potentially break DNSSEC, depending on a number of factors such
       as the location of the DNS64 function (at a DNS server or
       validator, at the end host, ...), how it has been configured, if
       the end hosts are validating, etc.

   2.  Because of the need to use DNS64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>] or an alternative
       &quot;host/application built-in&quot; mechanism for address synthesis,
       there may be an issue for NAT64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6146" title="&quot;Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6146</a>] because it doesn&#x27;t work
       when IPv4 literal addresses or non-IPv6-compliant APIs are being
       used.

   3.  NAT64 alone was not designed to provide a solution for IPv4-only
       hosts or applications that are located within a network and
       connected to a service provider IPv6-only access link, as it was
       designed for a very specific scenario (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc6144#section-2.1">Section&nbsp;2.1 of
       [RFC6144]</a>).

   The drawbacks discussed above may come into play if part of an
   enterprise network is connected to other parts of the same network or
   to third-party networks by means of IPv6-only connectivity.  This is
   just an example that may apply to many other similar cases.  All of
   them are deployment specific.

   Accordingly, the use of &quot;operator&quot;, &quot;operator network&quot;, &quot;service
   provider&quot;, and similar terms in this document are interchangeable
   with equivalent cases of enterprise networks; other cases may be
   similar as well.  This may be also the case for &quot;managed end-user
   networks&quot;.

   Note that if all the hosts in a network were performing address
   synthesis, as described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc6147#section-7.2">Section&nbsp;7.2 of [RFC6147]</a>, some of the
   drawbacks may not apply.  However, it is unrealistic to expect that
   in today&#x27;s world, considering the high number of devices and
   applications that aren&#x27;t yet IPv6 enabled.  In this document, the
   case in which all hosts provide synthesis will be considered only for
   specific scenarios that can guarantee it.

   An analysis of stateful IPv4/IPv6 mechanisms is provided in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6889" title="&quot;Analysis of Stateful 64 Translation&quot;">RFC6889</a>].

   This document looks into different possible NAT64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6146" title="&quot;Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6146</a>]
   deployment scenarios, including IPv4-IPv6-IPv4 (464 for short) and
   similar ones that were not documented in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6144" title="&quot;Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation&quot;">RFC6144</a>], such as 464XLAT
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>] in operator (broadband and cellular) and enterprise
   networks; it provides guidelines to avoid operational issues.

   This document also explores the possible NAT64 deployment scenarios
   (split in &quot;known to work&quot; and &quot;known to work under special
   conditions&quot;), providing a quick and generic comparison table among
   them.  Then, the document describes the issues that an operator needs
   to understand, which will allow the best approach/scenario to be
   defined for each specific network case.  A summary provides some
   recommendations and decision points.  A section with clarifications
   on the usage of this document for enterprise networks is also
   provided.  Finally, <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> provides an example of a broadband
   deployment using 464XLAT and hints for a customer-side translator
   (CLAT) implementation.

   [<a id="ref-RFC7269">RFC7269</a>] already provides information about NAT64 deployment options
   and experiences.  This document and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7269" title="&quot;NAT64 Deployment Options and Experience&quot;">RFC7269</a>] are complementary; they
   both look into different deployment considerations.  Furthermore,
   this document considers the updated deployment experience and newer
   standards.

   The target deployment scenarios in this document may also be covered
   by other IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) transition mechanisms.  Note
   that this is true only for broadband networks; in the case of
   cellular networks, the only supported solution is the use of
   NAT64/464XLAT.  So, it is out of scope of this document to provide a
   comparison among the different IPv4aaS transition mechanisms, which
   are analyzed in [<a href="#ref-IPv6-TRANSITION">IPv6-TRANSITION</a>].

   Consequently, this document should not be used as a guide for an
   operator or enterprise to decide which IPv4aaS is the best one for
   its own network.  Instead, it should be used as a tool for
   understanding all the implications, including relevant documents (or
   even specific parts of them) for the deployment of NAT64/464XLAT and
   for facilitating the decision process regarding specific deployment
   details.

   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  NAT64 Deployment Scenarios</span>

   DNS64 (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc6147#section-7">Section&nbsp;7 of [RFC6147]</a>) provides three deployment
   scenarios, depending on the location of the DNS64 function.  However,
   since the publication of that document, other deployment scenarios
   and NAT64 use cases need to be considered in actual networks, despite
   the fact that some of them were specifically ruled out by the
   original NAT64/DNS64 work.

   Consequently, the perspective in this document is to broaden those
   scenarios and include a few new ones.  However, in order to reduce
   the number of possible cases, we work under the assumption that the
   service provider wants to make sure that all the customers have a
   service without failures.  This means considering the following
   assumptions for the worst possible case:

   a.  There are hosts that will be validating DNSSEC.

   b.  IPv4 literal addresses and non-IPv6-compliant APIs are being
       used.

   c.  There are IPv4-only hosts or applications beyond the IPv6-only
       link (e.g., tethering in cellular networks).

   This document uses a common set of possible &quot;participant entities&quot;:

   1.  An IPv6-only access network (IPv6).

   2.  An IPv4-only remote network/server/service (IPv4).

   3.  A NAT64 function (NAT64) in the service provider.

   4.  A DNS64 function (DNS64) in the service provider.

   5.  An external service provider offering the NAT64 function and/or
       the DNS64 function (extNAT64/extDNS64).

   6.  A 464XLAT customer-side translator (CLAT).

   Note that the nomenclature used in parentheses is the one that, for
   short, will be used in the figures.  Note: for simplicity, the boxes
   in the figures don&#x27;t mean they are actually a single device; they
   represent one or more functions as located in that part of the
   network (i.e., a single box with NAT64 and DNS64 functions can
   actually be several devices, not just one).

   The possible scenarios are split in two general categories:

   1.  Known to work.

   2.  Known to work under special conditions.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Known to Work</span>

   The scenarios in this category are known to work, as there are well-
   known existing deployments from different operators using them.  Each
   one may have different pros and cons, and in some cases, the trade-
   offs may be acceptable for some operators.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.1" href="#section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Service Provider NAT64 with DNS64</span>

   In this scenario (Figure 1), the service provider offers both the
   NAT64 and DNS64 functions.

   This is the most common scenario as originally considered by the
   designers of NAT64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6146" title="&quot;Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6146</a>] and DNS64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>]; however, it may
   also have the implications related to the DNSSEC.

   This scenario may also fail to solve the issues of IPv4 literal
   addresses, non-IPv6-compliant APIs, or IPv4-only hosts or
   applications behind the IPv6-only access network.

                         Figure 1: NAT64 with DNS64

   A similar scenario (Figure 2) exists if the service provider offers
   only the DNS64 function; the NAT64 function is provided by an
   outsourcing agreement with an external provider.  All the
   considerations in the previous paragraphs of this section are the
   same for this sub-case.

              Figure 2: NAT64 in an External Service Provider

   This is equivalent to the scenario (Figure 3) where the outsourcing
   agreement with the external provider is to provide both the NAT64 and
   DNS64 functions.  Once more, all the considerations in the previous
   paragraphs of this section are the same for this sub-case.

             Figure 3: NAT64 and DNS64 in an External Provider

   One additional equivalent scenario (Figure 4) exists if the service
   provider only offers the NAT64 function; the DNS64 function is from
   an external provider with or without a specific agreement among them.
   This is a common scenario today, as several &quot;global&quot; service
   providers provide free DNS/DNS64 services, and users often configure
   their DNS manually.  This will only work if both the NAT64 and DNS64
   functions are using the Well-Known Prefix (WKP) or the same Network-
   Specific Prefix (NSP).  All the considerations in the previous
   paragraphs of this section are the same for this sub-case.

   Of course, if the external DNS64 function is agreed with the service
   provider, then this case is similar to the ones already depicted in
   this scenario.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.2" href="#section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Service Provider Offering 464XLAT Using DNS64</span>

   464XLAT [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>] describes an architecture that provides IPv4
   connectivity across a network, or part of it, when it is only
   natively transporting IPv6.  The need to support the CLAT function in
   order to ensure the IPv4 service continuity in IPv6-only cellular
   deployments has been suggested in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7849" title="&quot;An IPv6 Profile for 3GPP Mobile Devices&quot;">RFC7849</a>].

   In order to do that, 464XLAT [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>] relies on the combination of
   existing protocols:

   1.  The CLAT is a stateless IPv4-to-IPv6 translator (NAT46) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7915" title="&quot;IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm&quot;">RFC7915</a>]
       implemented in the end-user device or Customer Edge Router (CE),
       located at the &quot;customer edge&quot; of the network.

   2.  The provider-side translator (PLAT) is a stateful NAT64
       [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6146" title="&quot;Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6146</a>], implemented typically in the operator network.

   3.  Optionally, DNS64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>] may allow an optimization: a single
       translation at the NAT64, instead of two translations
       (NAT46+NAT64), when the application at the end-user device
       supports IPv6 DNS (uses AAAA Resource Records).

   Note that even if the provider-side translator is referred to as PLAT
   in the 464XLAT terminology [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>], for simplicity and uniformity
   across this document, it is always referred to as NAT64 (function).

   In this scenario (Figure 5), the service provider deploys 464XLAT
   with a DNS64 function.

   As a consequence, the DNSSEC issues remain, unless the host is doing
   the address synthesis.

   464XLAT [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>] is a very simple approach to cope with the major
   NAT64+DNS64 drawback: not working with applications or devices that
   use literal IPv4 addresses or non-IPv6-compliant APIs.

   464XLAT [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>] has been used mainly in IPv6-only cellular
   networks.  By supporting a CLAT function, end-user device
   applications can access IPv4-only end networks / applications,
   despite the fact that those applications or devices use literal IPv4
   addresses or non-IPv6-compliant APIs.

   In addition, in the cellular network example above, if the User
   Equipment (UE) provides tethering, other devices behind it will be
   presented with a traditional Network Address Translation from IPv4 to
   IPv4 (NAT44), in addition to the native IPv6 support, so clearly it
   allows IPv4-only hosts behind the IPv6-only access network.

   Furthermore, as discussed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>], 464XLAT can be used in
   broadband IPv6 network architectures, by implementing the CLAT
   function at the CE.

   The support of this scenario in a network offers two additional
   advantages:

   *  DNS load optimization: A CLAT should implement a DNS proxy (per
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5625" title="&quot;DNS Proxy Implementation Guidelines&quot;">RFC5625</a>]) so that only IPv6-native queries and AAAA records are
      sent to the DNS64 server.  Otherwise, doubling the number of
      queries may impact the DNS infrastructure.

   *  Connection establishment delay optimization: If the UE/CE
      implementation is detecting the presence of a DNS64 function, it
      may issue only the AAAA query, instead of both the AAAA and A
      queries.

   In order to understand all the communication possibilities, let&#x27;s
   assume the following representation of two dual-stack (DS) peers:

                   +-------+     .-----.                     .-----.
                   |       |    /       \                   /       \

                                | DNS64  |     \ Peer  /
                                +--------+      `-----&#x27;

      Figure A: Representation of 464XLAT among Two Peers with DNS64

   In this case, the possible communication paths, among the IPv4/IPv6
   stacks of both peers, are as follows:

   a.  Local-IPv6 to Remote-IPv6: Regular DNS and native IPv6 among
       peers.

   b.  Local-IPv6 to Remote-IPv4: DNS64 and NAT64 translation.

   c.  Local-IPv4 to Remote-IPv6: Not possible unless the CLAT
       implements Explicit Address Mappings (EAMs) as indicated by
       <a href="#section-4.9">Section 4.9</a>.  In principle, it is not expected that services are
       deployed in the Internet when using IPv6 only, unless there is
       certainty that peers will also be IPv6 capable.

   d.  Local-IPv4 to Remote-IPv4: DNS64, CLAT, and NAT64 translations.

   e.  Local-IPv4 to Remote-dual-stack using EAM optimization: If the
       CLAT implements EAM as indicated by <a href="#section-4.9">Section 4.9</a>, instead of using
       the path d. above, NAT64 translation is avoided, and the flow
       will use IPv6 from the CLAT to the destination.

   The rest of the figures in this section show different choices for
   placing the different elements.

   Figure 7: 464XLAT with DNS64; NAT64 and DNS64 in an External Provider

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.3" href="#section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a>.  Service Provider Offering 464XLAT, without Using DNS64</span>

   The major advantage of this scenario (Figure 8), using 464XLAT
   without DNS64, is that the service provider ensures that DNSSEC is
   never broken, even if the user modifies the DNS configuration.
   Nevertheless, some CLAT implementations or applications may impose an
   extra delay, which is induced by the dual A/AAAA queries (and the
   wait for both responses), unless Happy Eyeballs v2 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8305" title="&quot;Happy Eyeballs Version 2: Better Connectivity Using Concurrency&quot;">RFC8305</a>] is also
   present.

   A possible variation of this scenario is when DNS64 is used only for
   the discovery of the NAT64 prefix.  In the rest of the document, it
   is not considered a different scenario because once the prefix has
   been discovered, the DNS64 function is not used, so it behaves as if
   the DNS64 synthesis function is not present.

   In this scenario, as in the previous one, there are no issues related
   to IPv4-only hosts (or IPv4-only applications) behind the IPv6-only
   access network, as neither are related to the usage of IPv4 literals
   or non-IPv6-compliant APIs.

   The support of this scenario in a network offers one advantage:

   *  DNS load optimization: A CLAT should implement a DNS proxy (per
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5625" title="&quot;DNS Proxy Implementation Guidelines&quot;">RFC5625</a>]) so that only IPv6 native queries are sent to the DNS64
      server.  Otherwise, doubling the number of queries may impact the
      DNS infrastructure.

   As indicated earlier, the connection establishment delay optimization
   is achieved only in the case of devices, Operating Systems, or
   applications that use Happy Eyeballs v2 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8305" title="&quot;Happy Eyeballs Version 2: Better Connectivity Using Concurrency&quot;">RFC8305</a>], which is very
   common.

     Figure B: Representation of 464XLAT among Two Peers without DNS64

   In this case, the possible communication paths, among the IPv4/IPv6
   stacks of both peers, are as follows:

   a.  Local-IPv6 to Remote-IPv6: Regular DNS and native IPv6 among
       peers.

   b.  Local-IPv6 to Remote-IPv4: Regular DNS, CLAT, and NAT64
       translations.

   c.  Local-IPv4 to Remote-IPv6: Not possible unless the CLAT
       implements EAM as indicated by <a href="#section-4.9">Section 4.9</a>.  In principle, it is
       not expected that services are deployed in the Internet using
       IPv6 only, unless there is certainty that peers will also be
       IPv6-capable.

   d.  Local-IPv4 to Remote-IPv4: Regular DNS, CLAT, and NAT64
       translations.

   e.  Local-IPv4 to Remote-dual-stack using EAM optimization: If the
       CLAT implements EAM as indicated by <a href="#section-4.9">Section 4.9</a>, instead of using
       the path d. above, NAT64 translation is avoided, and the flow
       will use IPv6 from the CLAT to the destination.

   Notice that this scenario works while the local hosts/applications
   are dual stack (which is the current situation) because the
   connectivity from a local IPv6 to a remote IPv4 is not possible
   without a AAAA synthesis.  This aspect is important only when there
   are IPv6-only hosts in the LANs behind the CLAT and they need to
   communicate with remote IPv4-only hosts.  However, it is not a
   sensible approach from an Operating System or application vendor
   perspective to provide IPv6-only support unless, similar to case c
   above, there is certainty of peers supporting IPv6 as well.  An
   approach to a solution for this is also presented in [<a href="#ref-OPT-464XLAT">OPT-464XLAT</a>].

   The following figures show different choices for placing the
   different elements.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Known to Work under Special Conditions</span>

   The scenarios in this category are known not to work unless
   significant effort is devoted to solving the issues or they are
   intended to solve problems across &quot;closed&quot; networks instead of as a
   general Internet access usage.  Even though some of the different
   pros, cons, and trade-offs may be acceptable, operators have
   implementation difficulties, as their expectations of NAT64/DNS64 are
   beyond the original intent.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.1" href="#section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Service Provider NAT64 without DNS64</span>

   In this scenario (Figure 10), the service provider offers a NAT64
   function; however, there is no DNS64 function support at all.

   As a consequence, an IPv6 host in the IPv6-only access network will
   not be able to detect the presence of DNS64 by means of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7050" title="&quot;Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis&quot;">RFC7050</a>] or
   learn the IPv6 prefix to be used for the NAT64 function.

   This can be sorted out as indicated in <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>.

   Regardless, because of the lack of the DNS64 function, the IPv6 host
   will not be able to obtain AAAA synthesized records, so the NAT64
   function becomes useless.

   An exception to this &quot;useless&quot; scenario is to manually configure
   mappings between the A records of each of the IPv4-only remote hosts
   and the corresponding AAAA records with the WKP or NSP used by the
   service-provider NAT64 function, as if they were synthesized by a
   DNS64 function.

   This mapping could be done by several means, typically at the
   authoritative DNS server or at the service-provider resolvers by
   means of DNS Response Policy Zones (RPZs) [<a href="#ref-DNS-RPZ" title="&quot;DNS Response Policy Zones (RPZ)&quot;">DNS-RPZ</a>] or equivalent
   functionality.  DNS RPZ may have implications in DNSSEC if the zone
   is signed.  Also, if the service provider is using an NSP, having the
   mapping at the authoritative server may create troubles for other
   parties trying to use a different NSP or WKP, unless multiple DNS
   &quot;views&quot; (split-DNS) are also being used at the authoritative servers.

   Generally, the mappings alternative will only make sense if a few
   sets of IPv4-only remote hosts need to be accessed by a single
   network (or a small number of them), which supports IPv6 only in the
   access.  This will require some kind of mutual agreement for using
   this procedure; this should not be a problem because it won&#x27;t
   interfere with Internet use (which is a &quot;closed service&quot;).

   In any case, this scenario doesn&#x27;t solve the issue of IPv4 literal
   addresses, non-IPv6-compliant APIs, or IPv4-only hosts within that
   IPv6-only access network.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.2" href="#section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Service-Provider NAT64; DNS64 in IPv6 Hosts</span>

   In this scenario (Figure 11), the service provider offers the NAT64
   function but not the DNS64 function.  However, the IPv6 hosts have a
   built-in DNS64 function.

   This may become common if the DNS64 function is implemented in all
   the IPv6 hosts/stacks.  This is not common at the time of writing but
   may become more common in the near future.  This way, the DNSSEC
   validation is performed on the A record, and then the host can use
   the DNS64 function in order to use the NAT64 function without any
   DNSSEC issues.

   This scenario fails to solve the issue of IPv4 literal addresses or
   non-IPv6-compliant APIs, unless the IPv6 hosts also support Happy
   Eyeballs v2 (<a href="/doc/html/rfc8305#section-7.1">Section&nbsp;7.1 of [RFC8305]</a>).

   Moreover, this scenario also fails to solve the problem of IPv4-only
   hosts or applications behind the IPv6-only access network.

   In this scenario (Figure 12), the service provider offers the NAT64
   function only.  The IPv4-only remote network offers the DNS64
   function.

   This is not common, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense that a remote network,
   not deploying IPv6, is providing a DNS64 function.  Like the scenario
   depicted in <a href="#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a>, it will only work if both sides are using
   the WKP or the same NSP, so the same considerations apply.  It can
   also be tuned to behave as in <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a>.

   This scenario fails to solve the issue of IPv4 literal addresses or
   non-IPv6-compliant APIs.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Comparing the Scenarios</span>

   This section compares the different scenarios, including possible
   variations (each one represented in the previous sections by a
   different figure), while considering the following criteria:

   a.  DNSSEC: Are there hosts validating DNSSEC?

   b.  Literal/APIs: Are there applications using IPv4 literals or non-
       IPv6-compliant APIs?

   c.  IPv4 only: Are there hosts or applications using IPv4 only?

   d.  Foreign DNS: Does the scenario survive if the user, Operating
       System, applications, or devices change the DNS?

   e.  DNS load opt. (DNS load optimization): Are there extra queries
       that may impact the DNS infrastructure?

   f.  Connect. opt. (connection establishment delay optimization): Is
       the UE/CE only issuing the AAAA query or also the A query and
       waiting for both responses?

   In the table below, the columns represent each of the scenarios from
   the previous sections by the figure number.  The possible values are
   as follows:

      &quot;-&quot;   means the scenario is &quot;bad&quot; for that criterion.

      &quot;+&quot;   means the scenario is &quot;good&quot; for that criterion.

      &quot;*&quot;   means the scenario is &quot;bad&quot; for that criterion; however, it
            is typically resolved with the support of Happy Eyeballs v2
            [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8305" title="&quot;Happy Eyeballs Version 2: Better Connectivity Using Concurrency&quot;">RFC8305</a>].

   In some cases, &quot;countermeasures&quot;, alternative or special
   configurations, may be available for the criterion designated as
   &quot;bad&quot;.  So, this comparison is considering a generic case as a quick
   comparison guide.  In some cases, a &quot;bad&quot; criterion is not
   necessarily a negative aspect; it all depends on the specific needs/
   characteristics of the network where the deployment will take place.
   For instance, in a network that only has IPv6-only hosts and apps
   using DNS and IPv6-compliant APIs, there is no impact using only
   NAT64 and DNS64, but if the hosts validate DNSSEC, that criterion is
   still relevant.

                       Table 1: Scenario Comparison

   As a general conclusion, we should note if the network must support
   applications using any of the following:

   *  IPv4 literals

   *  non-IPv6-compliant APIs

   *  IPv4-only hosts or applications

   Then, only the scenarios with 464XLAT, a CLAT function, or equivalent
   built-in local address synthesis features will provide a valid
   solution.  Furthermore, those scenarios will also keep working if the
   DNS configuration is modified.  Clearly, depending on if DNS64 is
   used or not, DNSSEC may be broken for those hosts doing DNSSEC
   validation.

   All the scenarios are good in terms of DNS load optimization, and in
   the case of 464XLAT, it may provide an extra degree of optimization.
   Finally, all of the scenarios are also good in terms of connection
   establishment delay optimization.  However, in the case of 464XLAT
   without DNS64, the usage of Happy Eyeballs v2 is required.  This is
   not an issue as it is commonly available in actual Operating Systems.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Issues to be Considered</span>

   This section reviews the different issues that an operator needs to
   consider for a NAT64/464XLAT deployment, as they may develop specific
   decision points about how to approach that deployment.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  DNSSEC Considerations and Possible Approaches</span>

   As indicated in the security considerations for DNS64 (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc6147#section-8">Section&nbsp;8
   of [RFC6147]</a>) because DNS64 modifies DNS answers and DNSSEC is
   designed to detect such modifications, DNS64 may break DNSSEC.

   When a device connected to an IPv6-only access network queries for a
   domain name in a signed zone, by means of a recursive name server
   that supports DNS64, the result may be a synthesized AAAA record.  In
   that case, if the recursive name server is configured to perform
   DNSSEC validation and has a valid chain of trust to the zone in
   question, it will cryptographically validate the negative response
   from the authoritative name server.  This is the expected DNS64
   behavior: the recursive name server actually &quot;lies&quot; to the client
   device.  However, in most of the cases, the client will not notice
   it, because generally, they don&#x27;t perform validation themselves;
   instead, they rely on the recursive name servers.

   In fact, a validating DNS64 resolver increases the confidence on the
   synthetic AAAA, as it has validated that a non-synthetic AAAA doesn&#x27;t
   exist.  However, if the client device is oblivious to NAT64 (the most
   common case) and performs DNSSEC validation on the AAAA record, it
   will fail as it is a synthesized record.

   The best possible scenario from a DNSSEC point of view is when the
   client requests that the DNS64 server perform the DNSSEC validation
   (by setting the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit to 1 and the CD bit to 0).  In
   this case, the DNS64 server validates the data; thus, tampering may
   only happen inside the DNS64 server (which is considered as a trusted
   part, thus, its likelihood is low) or between the DNS64 server and
   the client.  All other parts of the system (including transmission
   and caching) are protected by DNSSEC [<a href="#ref-Threat-DNS64">Threat-DNS64</a>].

   Similarly, if the client querying the recursive name server is
   another name server configured to use it as a forwarder, and it is
   performing DNSSEC validation, it will also fail on any synthesized
   AAAA record.

   All those considerations are extensively covered in Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a>, <a href="#section-5.5">5.5</a>,
   and 6.2 of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>].

   DNSSEC issues could be avoided if all the signed zones provide IPv6
   connectivity together with the corresponding AAAA records.  However,
   this is out of the control of the operator needing to deploy a NAT64
   function.  This has been proposed already in [<a href="#ref-DNS-DNSSEC">DNS-DNSSEC</a>].

   An alternative solution, which was considered while developing
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>], is that the validators will be DNS64 aware.  Then, they
   can perform the necessary discovery and do their own synthesis.
   Since that was standardized sufficiently early in the validator
   deployment curve, the expectation was that it would be okay to break
   certain DNSSEC assumptions for networks that were stuck and really
   needing NAT64/DNS64.

   As already indicated, the scenarios in the previous section are
   simplified to look at the worst possible case and for the most
   perfect approach.  A DNSSEC breach will not happen if the end host is
   not doing validation.

   The figures in previous studies indicate that DNSSEC broken by using
   DNS64 makes up about 1.7% [<a href="#ref-About-DNS64">About-DNS64</a>] of the cases.  However, we
   can&#x27;t negate that this may increase as DNSSEC deployment grows.
   Consequently, a decision point for the operator must depend on the
   following question: Do I really care about that percentage of cases
   and the impact on my help desk, or can I provide alternative
   solutions for them?  Some possible solutions may be exist, as
   depicted in the next sections.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Not Using DNS64</span>

   One solution is to avoid using DNS64, but as already indicated, this
   is not possible in all the scenarios.

   The use of DNS64 is a key component for some networks, in order to
   comply with traffic performance metrics, monitored by some
   governmental bodies and other institutions [<a href="#ref-FCC" title="&quot;Measuring Broadband America Mobile 2013-2018 Coarsened Data&quot;">FCC</a>] [<a href="#ref-ARCEP" title="&quot;Service client des operateurs : les mesures de qualite de service&quot;">ARCEP</a>].

   One drawback of not having a DNS64 on the network side is that it&#x27;s
   not possible to heuristically discover NAT64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7050" title="&quot;Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis&quot;">RFC7050</a>].
   Consequently, an IPv6 host behind the IPv6-only access network will
   not be able to detect the presence of the NAT64 function, nor learn
   the IPv6 prefix to be used for it, unless it is configured by
   alternative means.

   The discovery of the IPv6 prefix could be solved, as described in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7050" title="&quot;Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis&quot;">RFC7050</a>], by means of adding the relevant AAAA records to the
   ipv4only.arpa. zone of the service-provider recursive servers, i.e.,
   if using the WKP (64:ff9b::/96):

               ipv4only.arpa.  SOA     . . 0 0 0 0 0
               ipv4only.arpa.  NS      .
               ipv4only.arpa.  AAAA    64:ff9b::192.0.0.170
               ipv4only.arpa.  AAAA    64:ff9b::192.0.0.171
               ipv4only.arpa.  A       192.0.0.170
               ipv4only.arpa.  A       192.0.0.171

   An alternative option is the use of DNS RPZ [<a href="#ref-DNS-RPZ" title="&quot;DNS Response Policy Zones (RPZ)&quot;">DNS-RPZ</a>] or equivalent
   functionalities.  Note that this may impact DNSSEC if the zone is
   signed.

   Another alternative, only valid in environments with support from the
   Port Control Protocol (PCP) (for both the hosts or CEs and for the
   service-provider network), is to follow &quot;Discovering NAT64 IPv6
   Prefixes Using the Port Control Protocol (PCP)&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7225" title="&quot;Discovering NAT64 IPv6 Prefixes Using the Port Control Protocol (PCP)&quot;">RFC7225</a>].

   Other alternatives may be available in the future.  All them are
   extensively discussed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7051" title="&quot;Analysis of Solution Proposals for Hosts to Learn NAT64 Prefix&quot;">RFC7051</a>]; however, due to the deployment
   evolution, many considerations from that document have changed.  New
   options are being documented, such as using Router Advertising
   [<a href="#ref-PREF64" title="&quot;Discovering PREF64 in Router Advertisements&quot;">PREF64</a>] or DHCPv6 options [<a href="#ref-DHCPv6-OPTIONS">DHCPv6-OPTIONS</a>].

   Simultaneous support of several of the possible approaches is
   convenient and will ensure that clients with different ways to
   configure the NAT64 prefix successfully obtain it.  This is also
   convenient even if DNS64 is being used.

   Also of special relevance to this section is [<a href="#ref-IPV4ONLY-ARPA">IPV4ONLY-ARPA</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.2" href="#section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  DNSSEC Validator Aware of DNS64</span>

   In general, by default, DNS servers with DNS64 function will not
   synthesize AAAA responses if the DO flag was set in the query.

   In this case, since only an A record is available, if a CLAT function
   is present, the CLAT will, as in the case of literal IPv4 addresses,
   keep that traffic flow end to end as IPv4 so DNSSEC is not broken.

   However, this will not work if a CLAT function is not present because
   the hosts will not be able to use IPv4 (which is the case for all the
   scenarios without 464XLAT).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.3" href="#section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a>.  Stub Validator</span>

   If the DO flag is set and the client device performs DNSSEC
   validation, and the Checking Disabled (CD) flag is set for a query,
   the DNS64 recursive server will not synthesize AAAA responses.  In
   this case, the client could perform the DNSSEC validation with the A
   record and then synthesize the AAAA responses [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6052" title="&quot;IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators&quot;">RFC6052</a>].  For that to
   be possible, the client must have learned the NAT64 prefix beforehand
   using any of the available methods (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7050" title="&quot;Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis&quot;">RFC7050</a>], [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7225" title="&quot;Discovering NAT64 IPv6 Prefixes Using the Port Control Protocol (PCP)&quot;">RFC7225</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-PREF64" title="&quot;Discovering PREF64 in Router Advertisements&quot;">PREF64</a>], and [<a href="#ref-DHCPv6-OPTIONS">DHCPv6-OPTIONS</a>]).  This allows the client device to
   avoid using the DNS64 function and still use NAT64 even with DNSSEC.

   If the end host is IPv4 only, this will not work if a CLAT function
   is not present (which is the case for all scenarios without 464XLAT).

   Instead of a CLAT, some devices or Operating Systems may implement an
   equivalent function by using Bump-in-the-Host [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6535" title="&quot;Dual-Stack Hosts Using &quot;">RFC6535</a>] as part of
   Happy Eyeballs v2 (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc8305#section-7.1">Section&nbsp;7.1 of [RFC8305]</a>).  In this case, the
   considerations in the above paragraphs are also applicable.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.4" href="#section-4.1.4">4.1.4</a>.  CLAT with DNS Proxy and Validator</span>

   If a CE includes CLAT support and also a DNS proxy, as indicated in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc6877#section-6.4">Section&nbsp;6.4 of [RFC6877]</a>, the CE could behave as a stub validator on
   behalf of the client devices.  Then, following the same approach
   described in <a href="#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3</a>, the DNS proxy will actually &quot;lie&quot; to the
   client devices, which, in most cases, will not be noticed unless they
   perform validation by themselves.  Again, this allows the client
   devices to avoid the use of the DNS64 function but to still use NAT64
   with DNSSEC.

   Once more, this will not work without a CLAT function (which is the
   case for all scenarios without 464XLAT).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.5" href="#section-4.1.5">4.1.5</a>.  ACL of Clients</span>

   In cases of dual-stack clients, AAAA queries typically take
   preference over A queries.  If DNS64 is enabled for those clients, it
   will never get A records, even for IPv4-only servers.

   As a consequence, in cases where there are IPv4-only servers, and
   those are located in the path before the NAT64 function, the clients
   will not be able to reach them.  If DNSSEC is being used for all
   those flows, specific addresses or prefixes can be left out of the
   DNS64 synthesis by means of Access Control Lists (ACLs).

   Once more, this will not work without a CLAT function (which is the
   case for all scenarios without 464XLAT).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.6" href="#section-4.1.6">4.1.6</a>.  Mapping Out IPv4 Addresses</span>

   If there are well-known specific IPv4 addresses or prefixes using
   DNSSEC, they can be mapped out of the DNS64 synthesis.

   Even if this is not related to DNSSEC, this &quot;mapping-out&quot; feature is
   quite commonly used to ensure that addresses [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1918" title="&quot;Address Allocation for Private Internets&quot;">RFC1918</a>] (for example,
   used by LAN servers) are not synthesized to AAAA.

   Once more, this will not work without a CLAT function (which is the
   case for all scenarios without 464XLAT).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  DNS64 and Reverse Mapping</span>

   When a client device using DNS64 tries to reverse-map a synthesized
   IPv6 address, the name server responds with a CNAME record that
   points the domain name used to reverse-map the synthesized IPv6
   address (the one under ip6.arpa) to the domain name corresponding to
   the embedded IPv4 address (under in-addr.arpa).

   This is the expected behavior, so no issues need to be considered
   regarding DNS reverse mapping.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Using 464XLAT with/without DNS64</span>

   In case the client device is IPv6 only (either because the stack or
   application is IPv6 only or because it is connected via an IPv6-only
   LAN) and the remote server is IPv4 only (either because the stack is
   IPv4 only or because it is connected via an IPv4-only LAN), only
   NAT64 combined with DNS64 will be able to provide access between
   both.  Because DNS64 is then required, DNSSEC validation will only be
   possible if the recursive name server is validating the negative
   response from the authoritative name server, and the client is not
   performing validation.

   Note that at this stage of the transition, it is not expected that
   applications, devices, or Operating Systems are IPv6 only.  It will
   not be a sensible decision for a developer to work on that direction,
   unless it is clear that the deployment scenario fully supports it.

   On the other hand, an end user or enterprise network may decide to
   run IPv6 only in the LANs.  In case there is any chance for
   applications to be IPv6 only, the Operating System may be responsible
   for either doing a local address synthesis or setting up some kind of
   on-demand VPN (IPv4-in-IPv6), which needs to be supported by that
   network.  This may become very common in enterprise networks, where
   &quot;Unique IPv6 Prefix per Host&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8273" title="&quot;Unique IPv6 Prefix per Host&quot;">RFC8273</a>] is supported.

   However, when the client device is dual stack and/or connected in a
   dual-stack LAN by means of a CLAT function (or has a built-in CLAT
   function), DNS64 is an option.

   1.  With DNS64: If DNS64 is used, most of the IPv4 traffic (except if
       using literal IPv4 addresses or non-IPv6-compliant APIs) will not
       use the CLAT and will instead use the IPv6 path, so only one
       translation will be done at the NAT64.  This may break DNSSEC,
       unless measures as described in the previous sections are taken.

   2.  Without DNS64: If DNS64 is not used, all the IPv4 traffic will
       make use of the CLAT, so two translations are required (NAT46 at
       the CLAT and NAT64 at the PLAT), which adds some overhead in
       terms of the extra NAT46 translation.  However, this avoids the
       AAAA synthesis and consequently will never break DNSSEC.

   Note that the extra translation, when DNS64 is not used, takes place
   at the CLAT, which means no extra overhead for the operator.
   However, it adds potential extra delays to establish the connections
   and has no perceptible impact for a CE in a broadband network, but it
   may have some impact on a battery-powered device.  The cost for a
   battery-powered device is possibly comparable to the cost when the
   device is doing a local address synthesis (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc8305#section-7.1">Section&nbsp;7.1 of
   [RFC8305]</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Foreign DNS</span>

   Clients, devices, or applications in a service-provider network may
   use DNS servers from other networks.  This may be the case if
   individual applications use their own DNS server, the Operating
   System itself or even the CE, or combinations of the above.

   Those &quot;foreign&quot; DNS servers may not support DNS64; as a consequence,
   those scenarios that require a DNS64 may not work.  However, if a
   CLAT function is available, the considerations in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a> will
   apply.

   If the foreign DNS supports the DNS64 function, incorrect
   configuration parameters may be provided that, for example, cause WKP
   or NSP to become unmatched or result in a case such as the one
   described in <a href="#section-3.2.3">Section 3.2.3</a>.

   Having a CLAT function, even if using foreign DNS without a DNS64
   function, ensures that everything will work, so the CLAT must be
   considered to be an advantage despite user configuration errors.  As
   a result, all the traffic will use a double translation (NAT46 at the
   CLAT and NAT64 at the operator network), unless there is support for
   EAM (<a href="#section-4.9">Section 4.9</a>).

   An exception is the case where there is a CLAT function at the CE
   that is not able to obtain the correct configuration parameters
   (again, causing WKP or NSP to become unmatched).

   However, it needs to be emphasized that if there is no CLAT function
   (which is the case for all scenarios without 464XLAT), an external
   DNS without DNS64 support will disallow any access to IPv4-only
   destination networks and will not guarantee the correct DNSSEC
   validation, so it will behave as in <a href="#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a>.

   In summary, the consequences of using foreign DNS depends on each
   specific case.  However, in general, if a CLAT function is present,
   most of the time there will not be any issues.  In the other cases,
   the access to IPv6-enabled services is still guaranteed for
   IPv6-enabled hosts, but it is not guaranteed for IPv4-only hosts nor
   is the access to IPv4-only services for any hosts in the network.

   The causes of &quot;foreign DNS&quot; could be classified in three main
   categories, as depicted in the following subsections.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  Manual Configuration of DNS</span>

   It is becoming increasingly common that end users, or even devices or
   applications, configure alternative DNS in their Operating Systems
   and sometimes in CEs.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.  DNS Privacy/Encryption Mechanisms</span>

   Clients or applications may use mechanisms for DNS privacy/
   encryption, such as DNS over TLS (DoT) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7858" title="&quot;Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)&quot;">RFC7858</a>], DNS over DTLS
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8094" title="&quot;DNS over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)&quot;">RFC8094</a>], DNS queries over HTTPS (DoH) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8484" title="&quot;DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)&quot;">RFC8484</a>], or DNS over QUIC
   (DoQ) [<a href="#ref-QUIC-CONNECTIONS">QUIC-CONNECTIONS</a>].

   Currently, those DNS privacy/encryption options are typically
   provided by the applications, not the Operating System vendors.  At
   the time this document was written, the DoT and DoH standards have
   declared DNS64 (and consequently NAT64) out of their scope, so an
   application using them may break NAT64, unless a correctly configured
   CLAT function is used.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4.3" href="#section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  Split DNS and VPNs</span>

   When networks or hosts use &quot;split-DNS&quot; (also called Split Horizon,
   DNS views, or private DNS), the successful use of DNS64 is not
   guaranteed.  This case is analyzed in <a href="/doc/html/rfc6950#section-4">Section&nbsp;4 of [RFC6950]</a>.

   A similar situation may happen with VPNs that force all the DNS
   queries through the VPN and ignore the operator DNS64 function.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Well-Known Prefix (WKP) vs. Network-Specific Prefix (NSP)</span>

   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of &quot;IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translator&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6052" title="&quot;IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators&quot;">RFC6052</a>]
   discusses some considerations that are useful to an operator when
   deciding if a WKP or an NSP should be used.

   Considering that discussion and other issues, we can summarize the
   possible decision points to as follows:

   a.  The WKP MUST NOT be used to represent non-global IPv4 addresses.
       If this is required because the network to be translated uses
       non-global addresses, then an NSP is required.

   b.  The WKP MAY appear in interdomain routing tables, if the operator
       provides a NAT64 function to peers.  However, in this case,
       special considerations related to BGP filtering are required, and
       IPv4-embedded IPv6 prefixes longer than the WKP MUST NOT be
       advertised (or accepted) in BGP.  An NSP may be a more
       appropriate option in those cases.

   c.  If several NAT64s use the same prefix, packets from the same flow
       may be routed to a different NAT64 in case of routing changes.
       This can be avoided by either using different prefixes for each
       NAT64 function or ensuring that all the NAT64s coordinate their
       state.  Using an NSP could simplify that.

   d.  If DNS64 is required and users, devices, Operating Systems, or
       applications may change their DNS configuration and deliberately
       choose an alternative DNS64 function, the alternative DNS64 will
       most likely use the WKP by default.  In that case, if an NSP is
       used by the NAT64 function, clients will not be able to use the
       operator NAT64 function, which will break connectivity to
       IPv4-only destinations.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.6" href="#section-4.6">4.6</a>.  IPv4 Literals and Non-IPv6-Compliant APIs</span>

   A host or application using literal IPv4 addresses or older APIs,
   which aren&#x27;t IPv6 compliant, behind a network with IPv6-only access
   will not work unless any of the following alternatives are provided:

   *  CLAT (or an equivalent function).

   *  Happy Eyeballs v2 (<a href="/doc/html/rfc8305#section-7.1">Section&nbsp;7.1 of [RFC8305]</a>).

   *  Bump-in-the-Host [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6535" title="&quot;Dual-Stack Hosts Using &quot;">RFC6535</a>] with a DNS64 function.

   Those alternatives will solve the problem for an end host.  However,
   if the end host is providing &quot;tethering&quot; or an equivalent service to
   other hosts, that needs to be considered as well.  In other words, in
   a cellular network, these alternatives resolve the issue for the UE
   itself, but this may not be the case for hosts connected via the
   tethering.

   Otherwise, the support of 464XLAT is the only valid and complete
   approach to resolve this issue.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.7" href="#section-4.7">4.7</a>.  IPv4-Only Hosts or Applications</span>

   IPv4-only hosts or an application behind a network with IPv6-only
   access will not work unless a CLAT function is present.

   464XLAT is the only valid approach to resolve this issue.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.8" href="#section-4.8">4.8</a>.  CLAT Translation Considerations</span>

   As described in &quot;IPv6 Prefix Handling&quot; (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc6877#section-6.3">Section&nbsp;6.3 of
   [RFC6877]</a>), if the CLAT function can be configured with a dedicated
   /64 prefix for the NAT46 translation, then it will be possible to do
   a more efficient stateless translation.

   Otherwise, if this dedicated prefix is not available, the CLAT
   function will need to do a stateful translation, for example, perform
   stateful NAT44 for all the IPv4 LAN packets so they appear as coming
   from a single IPv4 address; in turn, the CLAT function will perform a
   stateless translation to a single IPv6 address.

   A possible setup, in order to maximize the CLAT performance, is to
   configure the dedicated translation prefix.  This can be easily
   achieved automatically, if the broadband CE or end-user device is
   able to obtain a shorter prefix by means of DHCPv6-PD [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8415" title="&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)&quot;">RFC8415</a>] or
   other alternatives.  The CE can then use a specific /64 for the
   translation.  This is also possible when broadband is provided by a
   cellular access.

   The above recommendation is often not possible for cellular networks,
   when connecting smartphones (as UEs): generally they don&#x27;t use
   DHCPv6-PD [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8415" title="&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)&quot;">RFC8415</a>].  Instead, a single /64 is provided for each
   Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context, and prefix sharing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>] is
   used.  In this case, the UEs typically have a build-in CLAT function
   that is performing a stateful NAT44 translation before the stateless
   NAT46.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.9" href="#section-4.9">4.9</a>.  EAM Considerations</span>

   &quot;Explicit Address Mappings for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation&quot;
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7757" title="&quot;Explicit Address Mappings for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation&quot;">RFC7757</a>] provides a way to configure explicit mappings between IPv4
   and IPv6 prefixes of any length.  When this is used, for example, in
   a CLAT function, it may provide a simple mechanism in order to avoid
   traffic flows between IPv4-only nodes or applications and dual-stack
   destinations to be translated twice (NAT46 and NAT64), by creating
   mapping entries with the Global Unicast Address (GUA) of the
   IPv6-reachable destination.  This optimization of NAT64 usage is very
   useful in many scenarios, including Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
   and caches, as described in [<a href="#ref-OPT-464XLAT">OPT-464XLAT</a>].

   In addition, it may also provide a way for IPv4-only nodes or
   applications to communicate with IPv6-only destinations.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.10" href="#section-4.10">4.10</a>.  Incoming Connections</span>

   The use of NAT64, in principle, disallows IPv4 incoming connections,
   which may still be needed for IPv4-only peer-to-peer applications.
   However, there are several alternatives that resolve this issue:

   a.  Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5389" title="&quot;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)&quot;">RFC5389</a>], Traversal
       Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5766" title="&quot;Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)&quot;">RFC5766</a>], and Interactive
       Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8445" title="&quot;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal&quot;">RFC8445</a>] are commonly used by
       peer-to-peer applications in order to allow incoming connections
       with IPv4 NAT.  In the case of NAT64, they work as well.

   b.  The Port Control Protocol (PCP) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6887" title="&quot;Port Control Protocol (PCP)&quot;">RFC6887</a>] allows a host to
       control how incoming IPv4 and IPv6 packets are translated and
       forwarded.  A NAT64 may implement PCP to allow this service.

   c.  EAM [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7757" title="&quot;Explicit Address Mappings for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation&quot;">RFC7757</a>] may also be used in order to configure explicit
       mappings for customers that require them.  This is used, for
       example, by Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Data Center
       Environments (SIIT-DC) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7755" title="&quot;SIIT-DC: Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Data Center Environments&quot;">RFC7755</a>] and SIIT-DC Dual Translation
       Mode (SIIT-DC-DTM) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7756" title="&quot;Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Internet Data Center Environments (SIIT-DC): Dual Translation Mode&quot;">RFC7756</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Summary of Deployment Recommendations for NAT64/464XLAT</span>

   It has been demonstrated that NAT64/464XLAT is a valid choice in
   several scenarios (IPv6-IPv4 and IPv4-IPv6-IPv4), being the
   predominant mechanism in the majority of the cellular networks, which
   account for hundreds of millions of users [<a href="#ref-ISOC" title="&quot;State of IPv6 Deployment 2018&quot;">ISOC</a>].  NAT64/464XLAT
   offer different choices of deployment, depending on each network
   case, needs, and requirements.  Despite that, this document is not an
   explicit recommendation for using this choice versus other IPv4aaS
   transition mechanisms.  Instead, this document is a guide that
   facilitates evaluating a possible implementation of NAT64/464XLAT and
   key decision points about specific design considerations for its
   deployment.

   Depending on the specific requirements of each deployment case, DNS64
   may be a required function, while in other cases, the adverse effects
   may be counterproductive.  Similarly, in some cases, a NAT64
   function, together with a DNS64 function, may be a valid solution
   when there is a certainty that IPv4-only hosts or applications do not
   need to be supported (see Sections <a href="#section-4.6">4.6</a> and <a href="#section-4.7">4.7</a>).  However, in other
   cases (i.e., IPv4-only devices or applications that need to be
   supported), the limitations of NAT64/DNS64 may indicate that the
   operator needs to look into 464XLAT as a more complete solution.

   For broadband-managed networks (where the CE is provided or
   suggested/supported by the operator), in order to fully support the
   actual user&#x27;s needs (i.e., IPv4-only devices and applications and the
   usage of IPv4 literals and non-IPv6-compliant APIs), the 464XLAT
   scenario should be considered.  In that case, it must support a CLAT
   function.

   If the operator provides DNS services, they may support a DNS64
   function to avoid, as much as possible, breaking DNSSEC.  This will
   also increase performance, by reducing the double translation for all
   the IPv4 traffic.  In this case, if the DNS service is offering
   DNSSEC validation, then it must be in such a way that it is aware of
   the DNS64.  This is considered the simpler and safer approach, and it
   may be combined with other recommendations described in this
   document:

   *  DNS infrastructure MUST be aware of DNS64 (<a href="#section-4.1.2">Section 4.1.2</a>).

   *  Devices running CLAT SHOULD follow the indications in &quot;Stub
      Validator&quot; (see <a href="#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3</a>).  However, this may be out of the
      control of the operator.

   *  CEs SHOULD include a DNS proxy and validator (<a href="#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4</a>).

   *  &quot;ACL of Clients&quot; (see <a href="#section-4.1.5">Section 4.1.5</a>) and &quot;Mapping Out IPv4
      Addresses&quot; (see <a href="#section-4.1.6">Section 4.1.6</a>) MAY be considered by operators,
      depending on their own infrastructure.

   This &quot;increased performance&quot; approach has the disadvantage of
   potentially breaking DNSSEC for a small percentage of validating end
   hosts versus the small impact of a double translation taking place in
   the CE.  If CE performance is not an issue, which is the most
   frequent case, then a much safer approach is to not use DNS64 at all,
   and consequently, ensure that all the IPv4 traffic is translated at
   the CLAT (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>).

   If DNS64 is not used, at least one of the alternatives described in
   <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a> must be followed in order to learn the NAT64 prefix.

   The operator needs to consider that if the DNS configuration is
   modified (see Sections <a href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>, <a href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>, and <a href="#section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>), which most likely
   cannot be avoided, a foreign non-DNS64 could be used instead of
   configuring a DNS64.  In a scenario with only a NAT64 function, an
   IPv4-only remote host will no longer be accessible.  Instead, it will
   continue to work in the case of 464XLAT.

   Similar considerations need to be made regarding the usage of a NAT64
   WKP vs. NSP (<a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>), as they must match the configuration of
   DNS64.  When using foreign DNS, they may not match.  If there is a
   CLAT and the configured foreign DNS is not a DNS64, the network will
   keep working only if other means of learning the NAT64 prefix are
   available.

   For broadband networks, as described in <a href="#section-4.8">Section 4.8</a>, the CEs
   supporting a CLAT function SHOULD support DHCPv6-PD [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8415" title="&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)&quot;">RFC8415</a>] or
   alternative means for configuring a shorter prefix.  The CE SHOULD
   internally reserve one /64 for the stateless NAT46 translation.  The
   operator must ensure that the customers are allocated prefixes
   shorter than /64 in order to support this optimization.  One way or
   another, this is not impacting the performance of the operator
   network.

   Operators may follow &quot;Deployment Considerations&quot; (<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877#section-7">Section&nbsp;7 of
   [RFC6877]</a>) for suggestions on how to take advantage of traffic-
   engineering requirements.

   For cellular networks, the considerations regarding DNSSEC may appear
   to be out of scope because UEs&#x27; Operating Systems commonly don&#x27;t
   support DNSSEC.  However, applications running on them may, or it may
   be an Operating System &quot;built-in&quot; support in the future.  Moreover,
   if those devices offer tethering, other client devices behind the UE
   may be doing the validation; hence, proper DNSSEC support by the
   operator network is relevant.

   Furthermore, cellular networks supporting 464XLAT [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6877" title="&quot;464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation&quot;">RFC6877</a>] and
   &quot;Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis&quot;
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7050" title="&quot;Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis&quot;">RFC7050</a>] allow a progressive IPv6 deployment, with a single Access
   Point Name (APN) supporting all types of PDP context (IPv4, IPv6, and
   IPv4v6).  This approach allows the network to automatically serve
   every possible combination of UEs.

   If the operator chooses to provide validation for the DNS64 prefix
   discovery, it must follow the advice from &quot;Validation of Discovered
   Pref64::/n&quot; (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc7050#section-3.1">Section&nbsp;3.1 of [RFC7050]</a>).

   One last consideration is that many networks may have a mix of
   different complex scenarios at the same time; for example, customers
   that require 464XLAT and those that don&#x27;t, customers that require
   DNS64 and those that don&#x27;t, etc.  In general, the different issues
   and the approaches described in this document can be implemented at
   the same time for different customers or parts of the network.  That
   mix of approaches doesn&#x27;t present any problem or incompatibility;
   they work well together as a matter of appropriate and differentiated
   provisioning.  In fact, the NAT64/464XLAT approach facilitates an
   operator offering both cellular and broadband services to have a
   single IPv4aaS for both networks while differentiating the deployment
   key decisions to optimize each case.  It&#x27;s even possible to use
   hybrid CEs that have a main broadband access link and a backup via
   the cellular network.

   In an ideal world, we could safely use DNS64 if the approach proposed
   in [<a href="#ref-DNS-DNSSEC">DNS-DNSSEC</a>] were followed, avoiding the cases where DNSSEC may be
   broken.  However, this will not solve the issues related to DNS
   privacy and split DNS.

   The only 100% safe solution that also resolves all the issues is, in
   addition to having a CLAT function, not using a DNS64 but instead
   making sure that the hosts have a built-in address synthesis feature.
   Operators could manage to provide CEs with the CLAT function;
   however, the built-in address synthesis feature is out of their
   control.  If the synthesis is provided by either the Operating System
   (via its DNS resolver API) or the application (via its own DNS
   resolver) in such way that the prefix used for the NAT64 function is
   reachable for the host, the problem goes away.

   Whenever feasible, using EAM [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7757" title="&quot;Explicit Address Mappings for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation&quot;">RFC7757</a>] as indicated in <a href="#section-4.9">Section 4.9</a>
   provides a very relevant optimization, avoiding double translations.

   Applications that require incoming connections typically provide a
   means for that already.  However, PCP and EAM, as indicated in
   <a href="#section-4.10">Section 4.10</a>, are valid alternatives, even for creating explicit
   mappings for customers that require them.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Deployment of 464XLAT/NAT64 in Enterprise Networks</span>

   The recommendations in this document can also be used in enterprise
   networks, campuses, and other similar scenarios (including managed
   end-user networks).

   This includes scenarios where the NAT64 function (and DNS64 function,
   if available) are under the control of that network (or can be
   configured manually according to that network&#x27;s specific
   requirements), and there is a need to provide IPv6-only access to any
   part of that network, or it is IPv6 only connected to third-party
   networks.

   An example is the IETF meeting network itself, where both NAT64 and
   DNS64 functions are provided, presenting in this case the same issues
   as per <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a>.  If there is a CLAT function in the IETF
   network, then there is no need to use DNS64, and it falls under the
   considerations of <a href="#section-3.1.3">Section 3.1.3</a>.  Both scenarios have been tested and
   verified already in the IETF network.

   The following figures represent a few of the possible scenarios.

   Figure 13 provides an example of an IPv6-only enterprise network
   connected with a dual stack to the Internet using local NAT64 and
   DNS64 functions.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document does not have new specific security considerations
   beyond those already reported by each of the documents cited.  For
   example, DNS64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>] already describes the DNSSEC issues.

   As already described in <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>, note that there may be
   undesirable interactions, especially if using VPNs or DNS privacy,
   which may impact the correct performance of DNS64/NAT64.

   Note that the use of a DNS64 function has privacy considerations that
   are equivalent to regular DNS, and they are located in either the
   service provider or an external service provider.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Example of Broadband Deployment with 464XLAT</span>

   This section summarizes how an operator may deploy an IPv6-only
   network for residential/SOHO customers, supporting IPv6 inbound
   connections, and IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) by using 464XLAT.

   Note that an equivalent setup could also be provided for enterprise
   customers.  If they need to support IPv4 inbound connections, several
   mechanisms, depending on specific customer needs, allow it; see
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7757" title="&quot;Explicit Address Mappings for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation&quot;">RFC7757</a>].

   Conceptually, most of the operator network could be IPv6 only
   (represented in the next figures as &quot;IPv6-only flow&quot;), or even if
   part of the network is actually dual stack, only IPv6 access is
   available for some customers (i.e., residential customers).  This
   part of the network connects the IPv6-only subscribers (by means of
   IPv6-only access links) to the IPv6 upstream providers and to the
   IPv4-Internet by means of NAT64 (PLAT in the 464XLAT terminology).

   The traffic flow from and back to the CE to services available in the
   IPv6 Internet (or even dual-stack remote services, when IPv6 is being
   used) is purely native IPv6 traffic, so there are no special
   considerations about it.

   From the DNS perspective, there are remote networks with IPv4 only
   that will typically have only IPv4 DNS (DNS/IPv4) or will at least be
   seen as IPv4 DNS from the CE perspective.  On the operator side, the
   DNS, as seen from the CE, is only IPv6 (DNS/IPv6), and it also has a
   DNS64 function.

   On the customer LANs side, there is actually one network, which of
   course could be split into different segments.  The most common setup
   will be dual-stack segments, using global IPv6 addresses and
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1918" title="&quot;Address Allocation for Private Internets&quot;">RFC1918</a>] for IPv4, in any regular residential / Small Office, Home
   Office (SOHO) IPv4 network.  In the figure below, it is represented
   as tree segments to show that the three possible setups are valid
   (IPv6 only, IPv4 only, and dual stack).

             Figure 16: CE Setup with Built-In CLAT, with DNS64

   In addition to the regular CE setup, which typically will be access-
   technology dependent, the steps for the CLAT function configuration
   can be summarized as follows:

   1.  Discovery of the PLAT (NAT64) prefix: It may be done using
       [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7050" title="&quot;Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis&quot;">RFC7050</a>], [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7225" title="&quot;Discovering NAT64 IPv6 Prefixes Using the Port Control Protocol (PCP)&quot;">RFC7225</a>] in those networks where PCP is supported, or
       other alternatives that may be available in the future, such as
       Router Advertising [<a href="#ref-PREF64" title="&quot;Discovering PREF64 in Router Advertisements&quot;">PREF64</a>] or DHCPv6 options [<a href="#ref-DHCPv6-OPTIONS">DHCPv6-OPTIONS</a>].

   2.  If the CLAT function allows stateless NAT46 translation, a /64
       from the pool typically provided to the CE by means of DHCPv6-PD
       [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8415" title="&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)&quot;">RFC8415</a>] needs to be set aside for that translation.  Otherwise,
       the CLAT is forced to perform an intermediate stateful NAT44
       before the stateless NAT46, as described in <a href="#section-4.8">Section 4.8</a>.

   A more detailed configuration approach is described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8585" title="&quot;Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers to Support IPv4-as-a-Service&quot;">RFC8585</a>].

   The operator network needs to ensure that the correct responses are
   provided for the discovery of the PLAT prefix.  It is highly
   recommended that [<a href="#ref-RIPE-690" title="&quot;Best Current Operational Practice for Operators: IPv6 prefix assignment for end-users - persistent vs non- persistent, and what size to choose&quot;">RIPE-690</a>] be followed in order to ensure that
   multiple /64s are available, including the one needed for the NAT46
   stateless translation.

   The operator needs to understand other issues, as described
   throughout this document, in order to make relevant decisions.  For
   example, if several NAT64 functions are needed in the context of
   scalability / high availability, an NSP should be considered (see
   <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>).

   More complex scenarios are possible, for example, if a network offers
   multiple NAT64 prefixes, destination-based NAT64 prefixes, etc.

   If the operator decides not to provide a DNS64 function, then this
   setup will be the same as the following figure.  This will also be
   the setup that will be seen from the perspective of the CE, if a
   foreign DNS is used and consequently is not the operator-provided
   DNS64 function.

   In this case, the discovery of the PLAT prefix needs to be arranged
   as indicated in <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>.

   In addition, if the CE doesn&#x27;t have a built-in CLAT function, the
   customer can choose to set up the IPv6 operator-managed CE in bridge
   mode (and optionally use an external router).  Or, for example, if
   there is an access technology that requires some kind of media
   converter (Optical Network Termination (ONT) for fiber to the home
   (FTTH), Cable Modem for Data-Over-Cable Service Interface
   Specification (DOCSIS), etc.), the complete setup will look like
   Figure 18.  Obviously, there will be some intermediate configuration
   steps for the bridge, depending on the specific access technology/
   protocols, which should not modify the steps already described in the
   previous cases for the CLAT function configuration.

            Figure 18: CE Setup with Bridged CLAT, without DNS64

   Several routers (i.e., the operator-provided CE and the downstream
   user-provided router) that enable simultaneous routing and/or CLAT
   should be avoided to ensure that multiple NAT44 and NAT46 levels are
   not used and that the operation of multiple IPv6 subnets is correct.
   In those cases, the use of the Home Networking Control Protocol
   (HNCP) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8375" title="&quot;Special-Use Domain &#x27;home.arpa.&#x27;&quot;">RFC8375</a>] is suggested.

   Note that the procedure described here for the CE setup can be
   simplified if the CE follows [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8585" title="&quot;Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers to Support IPv4-as-a-Service&quot;">RFC8585</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B" href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  CLAT Implementation</span>

   In addition to the regular set of features for a CE, a CLAT CE
   implementation requires support for:

   *  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7915" title="&quot;IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm&quot;">RFC7915</a>] for the NAT46 function.

   *  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7050" title="&quot;Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis&quot;">RFC7050</a>] for the PLAT prefix discovery.

   *  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7225" title="&quot;Discovering NAT64 IPv6 Prefixes Using the Port Control Protocol (PCP)&quot;">RFC7225</a>] for the PLAT prefix discovery if PCP is supported.

   *  [<a href="#ref-PREF64" title="&quot;Discovering PREF64 in Router Advertisements&quot;">PREF64</a>] for the PLAT prefix discovery by means of Router
      Advertising.

   *  [<a href="#ref-DHCPv6-OPTIONS">DHCPv6-OPTIONS</a>] for the PLAT prefix discovery by means of DHCP.

   *  If stateless NAT46 is supported, a mechanism to ensure that
      multiple /64 are available, such as DHCPv6-PD [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8415" title="&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)&quot;">RFC8415</a>], must be
      used.

   There are several Open Source implementations of CLAT, such as:

   *  Android: <a href="https://github.com/ddrown/android_external_android-clat">https://github.com/ddrown/android_external_android-clat</a>

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C" href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  Benchmarking</span>

   A benchmarking methodology for IPv6 transition technologies has been
   defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8219" title="&quot;Benchmarking Methodology for IPv6 Transition Technologies&quot;">RFC8219</a>].  NAT64 and 464XLAT are addressed among the
   single- and double-translation technologies, respectively.  DNS64 is
   addressed in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>, and the methodology is elaborated in
   [<a href="#ref-DNS64-BM-Meth">DNS64-BM-Meth</a>] of that document.

   Several documents provide references to benchmarking results, for
   example, for DNS64 [<a href="#ref-DNS64-Benchm">DNS64-Benchm</a>].

   Conversations with Marcelo Bagnulo, one of the coauthors of NAT64 and
   DNS64, and email correspondence via the IETF mailing lists with Mark
   Andrews have been very useful for this work.

   Work on this document was inspired by Christian Huitema, who
   suggested that DNS64 should never be used when deploying CLAT in the
   IETF network.
