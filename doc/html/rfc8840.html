Abstract

   The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
   Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism for UDP-based
   multimedia sessions established with the Offer/Answer model.  The ICE
   extension for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE)
   defines a mechanism that allows ICE Agents to shorten session
   establishment delays by making the candidate gathering and
   connectivity checking phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing
   them in parallel.

   This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The document also defines a new
   SIP Info Package to support this usage together with the
   corresponding media type.  Additionally, a new Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attribute and a new SIP option tag
   &quot;trickle-ice&quot; are defined.

   The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8445" title="&quot;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal&quot;">RFC8445</a>]
   describes a mechanism for Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal
   that consists of three main phases.

   During the first phase, an agent gathers a set of candidate transport
   addresses (source IP, port, and transport protocol).  This is
   followed by a second phase where these candidates are sent to a
   remote agent within the Session Description Protocol (SDP) body of a
   SIP message.  At the remote agent, the gathering procedure is
   repeated and candidates are sent to the first agent.  Once the
   candidate information is available, a third phase starts in parallel
   where connectivity between all candidates in both sets is checked
   (connectivity checks).  Once these phases have been completed, and
   only then, both agents can begin communication.

   According to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8445" title="&quot;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal&quot;">RFC8445</a>], the three phases above happen consecutively,
   in a blocking way, which can introduce undesirable setup delay during
   session establishment.  The Trickle ICE extension [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>] defines
   generic semantics required for these ICE phases to happen in a
   parallel, non-blocking way and hence speeds up session establishment.

   This specification defines a usage of Trickle ICE with the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)[<a href="/doc/html/rfc3261" title="&quot;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol&quot;">RFC3261</a>].  It describes how ICE candidates
   are to be exchanged incrementally using SIP INFO requests [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6086" title="&quot;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework&quot;">RFC6086</a>]
   and how the Half Trickle and Full Trickle modes defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>]
   are to be used by SIP User Agents (UAs) depending on their
   expectations for support of Trickle ICE by a remote agent.

   This document defines a new Info Package as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6086" title="&quot;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework&quot;">RFC6086</a>]
   for use with Trickle ICE together with the corresponding media type,
   SDP attribute, and SIP option tag.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification makes use of terminology defined by the ICE
   protocol in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8445" title="&quot;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal&quot;">RFC8445</a>] and by its Trickle ICE extension in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>].
   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terminology from
   both documents.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8445">RFC8445</a>] also describes how ICE makes use of the Session Traversal
   Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5389" title="&quot;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)&quot;">RFC5389</a>] and its extension
   Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5766" title="&quot;Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)&quot;">RFC5766</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Protocol Overview</span>

   When using ICE for SIP according to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>], the ICE candidates are
   exchanged solely via SDP Offer/Answer as per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3264" title="&quot;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3264</a>].  This
   specification defines an additional mechanism where candidates can be
   exchanged using SIP INFO messages and a newly defined Info Package
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6086" title="&quot;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework&quot;">RFC6086</a>].  This also allows ICE candidates to be sent in parallel to
   an ongoing Offer/Answer negotiation and/or after the completion of
   the Offer/Answer negotiation.

   Typically, in cases where Trickle ICE is fully supported, the Offerer
   sends an INVITE request containing a subset of candidates.  Once an
   early dialog is established, the Offerer can continue sending
   candidates in INFO requests within that dialog.

   Similarly, an Answerer can send ICE candidates using INFO requests
   within the dialog established by its 18x provisional response.
   Figure 1 shows such a sample exchange:

               Figure 1: Sample Trickle ICE Scenario with SIP

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Discovery Issues</span>

   In order to benefit from Trickle ICE&#x27;s full potential and reduce
   session establishment latency to a minimum, Trickle ICE Agents need
   to generate SDP Offers and Answers that contain incomplete and
   potentially empty sets of candidates.  Such Offers and Answers can
   only be handled meaningfully by agents that actually support
   incremental candidate provisioning, which implies the need to confirm
   such support before using it.

   Contrary to other protocols, where &quot;in advance&quot; capability discovery
   is widely implemented, the mechanisms that allow this for SIP (i.e.,
   a combination of UA capabilities [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3840" title="&quot;Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)&quot;">RFC3840</a>] and Globally Routable User
   Agent URIs (GRUUs) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5627" title="&quot;Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)&quot;">RFC5627</a>]) have only seen low levels of adoption.
   This presents an issue for Trickle ICE implementations as SIP UAs do
   not have an obvious means of verifying that their peer will support
   incremental candidate provisioning.

   The Half Trickle mode of operation defined in the Trickle ICE
   specification [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>] provides one way around this, by requiring
   the first Offer to contain a complete set of local ICE candidates and
   using only incremental provisioning of remote candidates for the rest
   of the session.

   While using Half Trickle does provide a working solution, it also
   comes at the price of increased latency.  Therefore, <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> makes
   several alternative suggestions that enable SIP UAs to engage in Full
   Trickle right from their first Offer: <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> discusses the use
   of online provisioning as a means of allowing the use of Trickle ICE
   for all endpoints in controlled environments.  <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> describes
   anticipatory discovery for implementations that actually do support
   GRUU and UA capabilities, and <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a> discusses the
   implementation and use of Half Trickle by SIP UAs where none of the
   above are an option.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Relationship with the Offer/Answer Model</span>

   From the perspective of SIP middleboxes and proxies, the Offer/Answer
   exchange for Trickle ICE looks partly similar to the Offer/Answer
   exchange for regular ICE for SIP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>].  However, in order to
   have the full picture of the candidate exchange, the newly introduced
   INFO messages need to be considered as well.

        Figure 2: Distinguishing between Trickle ICE and Traditional
                                 Signaling

   From an architectural viewpoint, as displayed in Figure 2, exchanging
   candidates through SIP INFO requests could be represented as
   signaling between ICE modules and not between Offer/Answer modules of
   SIP UAs.  Then, such INFO requests do not impact the state of the
   Offer/Answer transaction other than providing additional candidates.
   Consequently, INFO requests are not considered Offers or Answers.
   Nevertheless, candidates that have been exchanged using INFO requests
   SHALL be included in subsequent Offers or Answers.  The version
   number in the &quot;o=&quot; line of that subsequent Offer needs to be
   incremented by 1 per the rules in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3264" title="&quot;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3264</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Incremental Signaling of ICE Candidates</span>

   Trickle ICE Agents will exchange ICE descriptions compliant to
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>] via Offer/Answer procedures and/or INFO request bodies.
   This requires the following SIP-specific extensions:

   1.  Trickle ICE Agents MUST indicate support for Trickle ICE by
       including the SIP option-tag &quot;trickle-ice&quot; in a SIP Supported:
       header field within all SIP INVITE requests and responses.

   2.  Trickle ICE Agents MUST indicate support for Trickle ICE by
       including the ice-option &quot;trickle&quot; within all SDP Offers and
       Answers in accordance to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>].

   3.  Trickle ICE Agents MAY include any number of ICE candidates,
       i.e., from zero to the complete set of candidates, in their
       initial Offer or Answer.  If the complete candidate set is
       already included in the initial Offer, it is called Half Trickle.

   4.  Trickle ICE Agents MAY exchange additional ICE candidates using
       INFO requests within an existing INVITE dialog usage (including
       an early dialog) as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6086" title="&quot;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework&quot;">RFC6086</a>].  The INFO requests
       carry an Info-Package: trickle-ice.  Trickle ICE Agents MUST be
       prepared to receive INFO requests within that same dialog usage,
       containing additional candidates and/or an indication that
       trickling of such candidates has ended.

   5.  Trickle ICE Agents MAY exchange additional ICE candidates before
       the Answerer has sent the Answer provided that an invite dialog
       usage is established at both Trickle ICE Agents.  Note that in
       case of forking, multiple early dialogs may exist.

   The following sections provide further details on how Trickle ICE
   Agents perform the initial Offer/Answer exchange (<a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>),
   perform subsequent Offer/Answer exchanges (<a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>), and
   establish the INVITE dialog usage (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>) such that they can
   incrementally trickle candidates (<a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Sending the Initial Offer</span>

   If the Offerer includes candidates in its initial Offer, it MUST
   encode these candidates as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>].

   If the Offerer wants to send its initial Offer before knowing any
   candidate for one or more media descriptions, it MUST set the port to
   the default value &#x27;9&#x27; for these media descriptions.  If the Offerer
   does not want to include the host IP address in the corresponding
   &quot;c=&quot;line, e.g., due to privacy reasons, it SHOULD include a default
   address in the &quot;c=&quot;line, which is set to the IPv4 address 0.0.0.0 or
   to the IPv6 equivalent ::.

   In this case, the Offerer obviously cannot know the RTP Control
   Protocol (RTCP) transport address; thus, it MUST NOT include the
   &quot;rtcp&quot; attribute [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3605" title="&quot;Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attribute in Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3605</a>].  This avoids potential ICE mismatch (see
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>]) for the RTCP transport address.

   If the Offerer wants to use RTCP multiplexing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5761" title="&quot;Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port&quot;">RFC5761</a>] and/or
   exclusive RTCP multiplexing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8858" title="&quot;Indicating Exclusive Support of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Multiplexing Using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC8858</a>], it still will include the
   &quot;rtcp-mux&quot; and/or &quot;rctp-mux-only&quot; attribute in the initial Offer.

   In any case, the Offerer MUST include the &quot;ice-options:trickle&quot;
   attribute in accordance to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>] and MUST include in each &quot;m=&quot;
   line a &quot;mid&quot; attribute in accordance to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5888" title="&quot;The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework&quot;">RFC5888</a>].  The &quot;mid&quot;
   attribute identifies the &quot;m=&quot; line to which a candidate belongs and
   helps in case of multiple &quot;m=&quot; lines, when candidate gathering could
   occur in an order different from the order of the &quot;m=&quot; lines.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.2" href="#section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  Receiving the Initial Offer</span>

   If the initial Offer included candidates, the Answerer uses these
   candidates to start ICE processing as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>].

   If the initial Offer included the &quot;ice-options:trickle&quot; attribute,
   the Answerer MUST be prepared for receiving trickled candidates later
   on.

   In case of a &quot;m/c=&quot; line with default values, none of the eventually
   trickled candidates will match the default destination.  This
   situation MUST NOT cause an ICE mismatch (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>]).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.3" href="#section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a>.  Sending the Initial Answer</span>

   If the Answerer includes candidates in its initial Answer, it MUST
   encode these candidates as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>].

   If the Answerer wants to send its initial Answer before knowing any
   candidate for one or more media descriptions, it MUST set the port to
   the default value &#x27;9&#x27; for these media descriptions.  If the Answerer
   does not want to include the host IP address in the corresponding
   &quot;c=&quot;line, e.g., due to privacy reasons, it SHOULD include a default
   address in the &quot;c=&quot;line, which is set to the IPv4 address 0.0.0.0 or
   to the IPv6 equivalent ::.

   In this case, the Answerer obviously cannot know the RTCP transport
   address; thus, it MUST NOT include the &quot;rtcp&quot; attribute [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6086" title="&quot;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework&quot;">RFC6086</a>].
   This avoids potential ICE mismatch (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>]) for the RTCP
   transport address.

   If the Answerer accepts the use of RTCP multiplexing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5761" title="&quot;Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port&quot;">RFC5761</a>] and/or
   exclusive RTCP multiplexing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8858" title="&quot;Indicating Exclusive Support of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Multiplexing Using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC8858</a>], it will include the &quot;rtcp-mux&quot;
   attribute in the initial Answer.

   In any case, the Answerer MUST include the &quot;ice-options:trickle&quot;
   attribute in accordance to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>] and MUST include in each &quot;m=&quot;
   line a &quot;mid&quot; attribute in accordance to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5888" title="&quot;The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework&quot;">RFC5888</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.4" href="#section-4.1.4">4.1.4</a>.  Receiving the Initial Answer</span>

   If the initial Answer included candidates, the Offerer uses these
   candidates to start ICE processing as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>].

   In case of a &quot;m/c=&quot; line with default values, none of the eventually
   trickled candidates will match the default destination.  This
   situation MUST NOT cause an ICE mismatch (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>]).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Subsequent Offer/Answer Exchanges</span>

   Subsequent Offer/Answer exchanges are handled the same as regular ICE
   (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc8839#section-4.4">Section&nbsp;4.4 of [RFC8839]</a>).

   If an Offer or Answer needs to be sent while the ICE Agents are in
   the middle of trickling, <a href="/doc/html/rfc8839#section-4.4">Section&nbsp;4.4 of [RFC8839]</a> applies.  This
   means that an ICE Agent includes candidate attributes for all local
   candidates it had trickled previously for a specific media stream.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Establishing the Dialog</span>

   In order to be able to start trickling, the following two conditions
   need to be satisfied at the SIP UAs:

   *  Trickle ICE support at the peer agent MUST be confirmed.

   *  A dialog MUST have been created between the peers.

   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> discusses in detail the various options for satisfying the
   first of the above conditions.  However, regardless of those
   mechanisms, agents are certain to have a clear understanding of
   whether their peers support trickle ICE once an Offer and an Answer
   have been exchanged, which also allows for ICE processing to commence
   (see Figure 3).

     Figure 3: A SIP Offerer can freely trickle as soon as it receives
                                 an Answer

   As shown in Figure 3, satisfying both conditions is relatively
   trivial for ICE Agents that have sent an Offer in an INVITE and that
   have received an Answer in a reliable provisional response.  It is
   guaranteed to have confirmed support (or lack thereof) for Trickle
   ICE at the Answerer and to have fully initialized the SIP dialog at
   both ends.  Offerers and Answerers (after receipt of the PRACK
   request) in the above situation can therefore freely commence
   trickling within the newly established dialog.

<span class="h4">        Delivery</span>

   The situation is a bit more delicate for agents that have received an
   Offer in an INVITE request and have sent an Answer in an unreliable
   provisional response because, once the response has been sent, the
   Answerer does not know when or if it has been received (Figure 4).

       dialog at the side of the Offerer has entered the early state

   In order to clear this ambiguity as soon as possible, the Answerer
   needs to retransmit the provisional response with the exponential
   backoff timers described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3262" title="&quot;Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)&quot;">RFC3262</a>].  These retransmissions MUST
   cease on receipt of an INFO request carrying a &quot;trickle-ice&quot; Info
   Package body, on receipt of any other in-dialog request from the
   Offerer, or on transmission of the Answer in a 2xx response.  The
   Offerer cannot send in-dialog requests until it receives a response,
   so the arrival of such a request proves that the response has
   arrived.  Using the INFO request for dialog confirmation is similar
   to the procedure described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8839#section-7.1.1">Section&nbsp;7.1.1 of [RFC8839]</a>, except that
   the STUN binding request is replaced by the INFO request.

   The Offerer MUST send a Trickle ICE INFO request as soon as it
   receives an SDP Answer in an unreliable provisional response.  This
   INFO request MUST repeat the candidates that were already provided in
   the Offer (as would be the case when Half Trickle is performed or
   when new candidates have not been learned since then).  The first
   case could happen when Half Trickle is used and all candidates are
   already in the initial offer.  The second case could happen when Full
   Trickle is used and the Offerer is currently gathering additional
   candidates but did not yet get them.  Also, if the initial Offer did
   not contain any candidates, depending on how the Offerer gathers its
   candidates and how long it takes to do so, this INFO could still
   contain no candidates.

   When Full Trickle is used and if newly learned candidates are
   available, the Offerer SHOULD also deliver these candidates in said
   INFO request, unless it wants to hold back some candidates in
   reserve, e.g., in case these candidates are expensive to use and
   would only be trickled if all other candidates failed.

   The Offerer SHOULD include an &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attribute in case
   candidate discovery has ended in the meantime and no further
   candidates are to be trickled.

   As soon as an Answerer has received such an INFO request, the
   Answerer has an indication that a dialog is established at both ends
   and trickling can begin (Figure 5).

   Note: The &quot;+SRFLX&quot; in Figure 5 indicates that additional newly
   learned server-reflexive candidates are included.

     Figure 5: A SIP UA that received an INFO request after sending an
     unreliable provisional response knows that the dialog at the side
                of the receiver has entered the early state

   When sending the Answer in the 200 OK response to the INVITE request,
   the Answerer needs to repeat exactly the same Answer that was
   previously sent in the unreliable provisional response in order to
   fulfill the corresponding requirements in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3264" title="&quot;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3264</a>].  Thus, the
   Offerer needs to be prepared for receiving a different number of
   candidates in that repeated Answer than previously exchanged via
   trickling and MUST ignore the candidate information in that 200 OK
   response.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3.3" href="#section-4.3.3">4.3.3</a>.  Initiating Trickle ICE without an SDP Answer</span>

   The ability to convey arbitrary candidates in INFO message bodies
   allows ICE Agents to initiate trickling without actually sending an
   Answer.  Trickle ICE Agents can therefore respond to an INVITE
   request with provisional responses without an SDP Answer [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3261" title="&quot;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol&quot;">RFC3261</a>].
   Such provisional responses serve for establishing an early dialog.

   Agents that choose to establish the dialog in this way MUST
   retransmit these responses with the exponential backoff timers
   described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3262" title="&quot;Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)&quot;">RFC3262</a>].  These retransmissions MUST cease on receipt
   of an INFO request carrying a &quot;trickle-ice&quot; Info Package body, on
   receipt of any in-dialog requests from the Offerer, or on
   transmission of the Answer in a 2xx response.  The Offerer cannot
   send in-dialog requests until it receives a response, so the arrival
   of such a request proves that the response has arrived.  This is
   again similar to the procedure described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8839#section-6.1.1">Section&nbsp;6.1.1 of
   [RFC8839]</a>, except that an Answer is not yet provided.

        Figure 6: A SIP UA sends an unreliable provisional response
             without an Answer for establishing an early dialog

   When sending the Answer, the agent MUST repeat all currently known
   and used candidates, if any, and MAY include all newly gathered
   candidates since the last INFO request was sent.  However, if that
   Answer was already sent in an unreliable provisional response, the
   Answerers MUST repeat exactly the same Answer in the 200 OK response
   to the INVITE request in order to fulfill the corresponding
   requirements in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3264" title="&quot;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3264</a>].  In case that trickling continued, an
   Offerer needs to be prepared for receiving fewer candidates in that
   repeated Answer than previously exchanged via trickling and MUST
   ignore the candidate information in that 200 OK response.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Delivering Candidates in INFO Requests</span>

   Whenever new ICE candidates become available for sending, agents
   encode them in &quot;candidate&quot; attributes as described by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>].  For
   example:

     a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706432 200a0b:12f0::1 5000 typ host

   The use of SIP INFO requests happens within the context of the Info
   Package as defined in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.  The media type [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6838" title="&quot;Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures&quot;">RFC6838</a>] for their
   payload MUST be set to &quot;application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag&quot; as defined
   in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.  The INFO request body adheres to the grammar as
   specified in <a href="#section-9.2">Section 9.2</a>.

   Since neither the &quot;candidate&quot; nor the &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attributes
   contain information that would allow correlating them to a specific
   &quot;m=&quot; line, it is handled through the use of pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines.

   Pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines follow the SDP syntax for &quot;m=&quot; lines as defined in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4566" title="&quot;SDP: Session Description Protocol&quot;">RFC4566</a>] and are linked to the corresponding &quot;m=&quot; line in the SDP
   Offer or Answer via the identification tag in a &quot;mid&quot; attribute
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5888" title="&quot;The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework&quot;">RFC5888</a>].  A pseudo &quot;m=&quot; line does not provide semantics other than
   indicating to which &quot;m=&quot; line a candidate belongs.  Consequently, the
   receiving agent MUST ignore any remaining content of the pseudo &quot;m=&quot;
   line, which is not defined in this document.  This guarantees that
   the &quot;application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag&quot; bodies do not interfere with
   the Offer/Answer procedures as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3264" title="&quot;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3264</a>].

   When sending the INFO request, the agent MAY, if already known to the
   agent, include the same content into the pseudo &quot;m=&quot; line as for the
   &quot;m=&quot; line in the corresponding Offer or Answer.  However, since
   Trickle ICE might be decoupled from the Offer/Answer negotiation, the
   content might be unknown to the agent.  In this case, the agent MUST
   include the following default values:

   *  The media field is set to &#x27;audio&#x27;.

   *  The port value is set to &#x27;9&#x27;.

   *  The proto value is set to &#x27;RTP/AVP&#x27;.

   *  The fmt field MUST appear only once and is set to &#x27;0&#x27;.

   Agents MUST include a pseudo &quot;m=&quot; line and an identification tag in a
   &quot;mid&quot; attribute for every &quot;m=&quot; line whose candidate list they intend
   to update.  Such &quot;mid&quot; attributes MUST immediately precede the list
   of candidates for that specific &quot;m=&quot; line.

   All &quot;candidate&quot; or &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attributes following a &quot;mid&quot;
   attribute, up until (and excluding) the next occurrence of a pseudo
   &quot;m=&quot; line, pertain to the &quot;m=&quot; line identified by that identification
   tag.

   Note, that there is no requirement that the INFO request body
   contains as many pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines as the Offer/Answer contains &quot;m=&quot;
   lines, nor that the pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines be in the same order as the
   &quot;m=&quot; lines that they pertain to.  The correspondence can be made via
   the &quot;mid&quot; attributes since candidates are grouped in sections headed
   by &quot;pseudo&quot; &quot;m=&quot; lines.  These sections contain &quot;mid&quot; attribute
   values that point back to the true &quot;m=&quot; line.

   An &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attribute, preceding the first pseudo &quot;m=&quot;
   line, indicates the end of all trickling from that agent, as opposed
   to end of trickling for a specific &quot;m=&quot; line, which would be
   indicated by a media-level &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attribute.

   Refer to Figure 7 for an example of the INFO request content.

   The use of pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines allows for a structure similar to the
   one in SDP Offers and Answers where separate media-level and session-
   level sections can be distinguished.  In the current case, lines
   preceding the first pseudo &quot;m=&quot; line are considered to be session
   level.  Lines appearing in between or after pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines will be
   interpreted as media level.

      |  Note that while this specification uses the &quot;mid&quot; attribute
      |  from [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5888" title="&quot;The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework&quot;">RFC5888</a>], it does not define any grouping semantics.

   All INFO requests MUST carry the &quot;ice-pwd&quot; and &quot;ice-ufrag&quot; attributes
   that allow mapping them to a specific ICE generation.  An agent MUST
   discard any received INFO requests containing &quot;ice-pwd&quot; and &quot;ice-
   ufrag&quot; attributes that do not match those of the current ICE
   Negotiation Session.

   The &quot;ice-pwd&quot; and &quot;ice-ufrag&quot; attributes MUST appear at the same
   level as the ones in the Offer/Answer exchange.  In other words, if
   they were present as session-level attributes, they will also appear
   at the beginning of all INFO request payloads, i.e., preceding the
   first pseudo &quot;m=&quot; line.  If they were originally exchanged as media-
   level attributes, potentially overriding session-level values, then
   they will also be included in INFO request payloads following the
   corresponding pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines.

   Note that when candidates are trickled, [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>] requires that each
   candidate must be delivered to the receiving Trickle ICE
   implementation not more than once and in the same order as it was
   conveyed.  If the signaling protocol provides any candidate
   retransmissions, they need to be hidden from the ICE implementation.
   This requirement is fulfilled as follows.

   Since the agent is not fully aware of the state of the ICE
   Negotiation Session at its peer, it MUST include all currently known
   and used local candidates in every INFO request.  That is, the agent
   MUST repeat in the INFO request body all candidates that were
   previously sent under the same combination of &quot;ice-pwd&quot; and &quot;ice-
   ufrag&quot; in the same order as they were sent before.  In other words,
   the sequence of a previously sent list of candidates MUST NOT change
   in subsequent INFO requests, and newly gathered candidates MUST be
   added at the end of that list.  Although repeating all candidates
   creates some overhead, it also allows easier handling of problems
   that could arise from unreliable transports like, e.g., loss of
   messages and reordering, which can be detected through the CSeq:
   header field in the INFO request.

   In addition, an ICE Agent needs to adhere to <a href="/doc/html/rfc8838#section-17">Section&nbsp;17 of [RFC8838]</a>
   on preserving candidate order while trickling.

   When receiving INFO requests carrying any candidates, agents MUST
   first identify and discard the attribute lines containing candidates
   they have already received in previous INFO requests or in the Offer/
   Answer exchange preceding them.

   Such candidates are considered to be equal if their IP address port,
   transport, and component ID are the same.  After identifying and
   discarding the known candidates, the agents MUST forward the actual
   new candidates to the ICE Agents in the same order as they were
   received in the INFO request body.  The ICE Agents will then process
   the new candidates according to the rules described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>].

   Receiving an &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attribute in an INFO request body --
   with the &quot;ice-ufrag&quot; and &quot;ice-pwd&quot; attributes matching the current
   ICE generation -- is an indication from the peer agent that it will
   not send any further candidates.  When included at the session level,
   i.e., before any pseudo &quot;m=&quot; line, this indication applies to the
   whole session; when included at the media level, the indication
   applies only to the corresponding &quot;m=&quot; line.  Handling of such end-
   of-candidates indications is defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>].

   The example in Figure 7 shows the content of a candidate delivering
   INFO request.  In the example, the &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attributes
   indicate that the candidate gathering is finished and that no further
   INFO requests follow.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Initial Discovery of Trickle ICE Support</span>

   SIP UAs are required by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>] to indicate their support of and
   intent to use Trickle ICE in their Offers and Answers by using the
   &quot;ice-options:trickle&quot; attribute, and they MUST include the SIP
   option-tag &quot;trickle-ice&quot; in a SIP Supported: or Require: header
   field.  This makes discovery fairly straightforward for Answerers or
   for cases where Offers need to be generated within existing dialogs
   (i.e., when sending UPDATE or re-INVITE requests).  In both
   scenarios, prior SDP bodies will have provided the necessary
   information.

   Obviously, such information is not available at the time a first
   Offer is being constructed, and it is therefore impossible for ICE
   Agents to determine support for incremental provisioning that way.
   The following options are suggested as ways of addressing this issue.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Provisioning Support for Trickle ICE</span>

   In certain situations, it may be possible for integrators deploying
   Trickle ICE to know in advance that some or all endpoints reachable
   from within the deployment will support Trickle ICE.  This is the
   case, for example, if Session Border Controllers (SBCs) with support
   for this specification are used to connect to UAs that do not support
   Trickle ICE.

   While the exact mechanism for allowing such provisioning is out of
   scope here, this specification encourages trickle ICE implementations
   to allow the option in the way they find most appropriate.

   However, an Offerer assuming Trickle ICE support MUST include a SIP
   Require: trickle-ice header field.  That way, if the provisioned
   assumption of Trickle ICE support ends up being incorrect, the
   failure is (a) operationally easy to track down and (b) recoverable
   by the client, i.e., they can resend the request without the SIP
   Require: header field and without the assumption of Trickle ICE
   support.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Trickle ICE Discovery with Globally Routable User Agent URIs</span>
      (GRUUs)

   [<a id="ref-RFC3840">RFC3840</a>] provides a way for SIP UAs to query for support of specific
   capabilities using, among others, OPTIONS requests.  On the other
   hand, support for GRUU according to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5627" title="&quot;Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)&quot;">RFC5627</a>] allows SIP requests to
   be addressed to specific UAs (as opposed to arbitrary instances of an
   address of record).  Combining the two and using the &quot;trickle-ice&quot;
   option tag defined in <a href="#section-10.6">Section 10.6</a> provides SIP UAs with a way of
   learning the capabilities of specific SIP UA instances and then
   addressing them directly with INVITE requests that require Trickle
   ICE support.

   Such learning of capabilities may happen in different ways.  One
   option for a SIP UA is to learn the GRUU instance ID of a peer
   through presence and then to query its capabilities with an OPTIONS
   request.  Alternatively, it can also just send an OPTIONS request to
   the Address of Record (AOR) it intends to contact and then inspect
   the returned response(s) for support of both GRUU and Trickle ICE
   (Figure 8).  It is noted that using the GRUU means that the INVITE
   request can go only to that particular device.  This prevents the use
   of forking for that request.

       Figure 8: Trickle ICE Support Discovery with OPTIONS and GRUU

   Confirming support for Trickle ICE through [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3840" title="&quot;Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)&quot;">RFC3840</a>] gives SIP UAs
   the option to engage in Full Trickle negotiation (as opposed to the
   more lengthy Half Trickle) from the very first Offer they send.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Fall Back to Half Trickle</span>

   In cases where none of the other mechanisms in this section are
   acceptable, SIP UAs should use the Half Trickle mode defined in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>].  With Half Trickle, agents initiate sessions the same way
   they would when using ICE for SIP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>].  This means that, prior
   to actually sending an Offer, agents first gather ICE candidates in a
   blocking way and then send them all in that Offer.  The blocking
   nature of the process implies that some amount of latency will be
   accumulated, and it is advised that agents try to anticipate it where
   possible, for example, when user actions indicate a high likelihood
   for an imminent call (e.g., activity on a keypad or a phone going off
   hook).

   Using Half Trickle results in Offers that are compatible with both
   ICE SIP endpoints [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>] and legacy endpoints [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3264" title="&quot;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3264</a>].

    Figure 9: Example of a Typical (Half) Trickle ICE Exchange with SIP

   As a reminder, once a single Offer or Answer has been exchanged
   within a specific dialog, support for Trickle ICE will have been
   determined.  No further use of Half Trickle will therefore be
   necessary within that same dialog, and all subsequent exchanges can
   use the Full Trickle mode of operation.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Considerations for RTP and RTCP Multiplexing</span>

   The following consideration describes options for Trickle ICE in
   order to give some guidance to implementers on how trickling can be
   optimized with respect to providing RTCP candidates.

   Handling of the &quot;rtcp&quot; attribute [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3605" title="&quot;Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attribute in Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3605</a>] and the &quot;rtcp-mux&quot;
   attribute for RTP/RTCP multiplexing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5761" title="&quot;Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port&quot;">RFC5761</a>] is already considered
   in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8445#section-5.1.1.1">Section&nbsp;5.1.1.1 of [RFC8445]</a> and in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5761" title="&quot;Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port&quot;">RFC5761</a>].  These
   considerations are still valid for Trickle ICE; however, trickling
   provides more flexibility for the sequence of candidate exchange in
   case of RTCP multiplexing.

   If the Offerer supports RTP/RTCP multiplexing exclusively as
   specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8858" title="&quot;Indicating Exclusive Support of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Multiplexing Using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC8858</a>], the procedures in that document apply for the
   handling of the &quot;rtcp-mux-only&quot;, &quot;rtcp&quot;, and &quot;rtcp-mux&quot; attributes.

   While a Half Trickle Offerer has to send an Offer compliant to
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5761" title="&quot;Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port&quot;">RFC5761</a>] including candidates for all components, the
   flexibility of a Full Trickle Offerer allows the sending of only RTP
   candidates (component 1) in the initial Offer assuming that RTCP
   multiplexing is supported by the Answerer.  A Full Trickle Offerer
   would need to start gathering and trickling RTCP candidates
   (component 2) only after having received an indication in the Answer
   that the Answerer unexpectedly does not support RTCP multiplexing.

   A Trickle Answerer MAY include an &quot;rtcp-mux&quot; attribute [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5761" title="&quot;Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port&quot;">RFC5761</a>] in
   the &quot;application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag&quot; body if it supports and uses
   RTP and RTCP multiplexing.  The Trickle Answerer needs to follow the
   guidance on the usage of the &quot;rtcp&quot; attribute as given in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8839" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer Procedures for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)&quot;">RFC8839</a>]
   and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3605" title="&quot;Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attribute in Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3605</a>].  Receipt of this attribute at the Offerer in an INFO
   request prior to the Answer indicates that the Answerer supports and
   uses RTP and RTCP multiplexing.  The Offerer can use this
   information, e.g., for stopping the gathering of RTCP candidates and/
   or for freeing corresponding resources.

   This behavior is illustrated by the following example Offer that
   indicates support for RTP and RTCP multiplexing.

     a=rtcp-mux
     a=candidate:1 1 UDP 1658497328 2001:db8:a0b:12f0::3 5000 typ host

   Once the dialog is established as described in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>, the
   Answerer sends the following INFO request.

     INFO sip:alice@example.com SIP/2.0
     ...
     Info-Package: trickle-ice
     Content-type: application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag
     Content-Disposition: Info-Package

     a=rtcp-mux
     a=candidate:1 1 UDP 1658497382 2001:db8:a0b:12f0::4 6000 typ host

   This INFO request indicates that the Answerer supports and uses RTP
   and RTCP multiplexing as well.  It allows the Offerer to omit
   gathering RTCP candidates or releasing already gathered RTCP
   candidates.  If the INFO request did not contain the &quot;rtcp-mux&quot;
   attribute, the Offerer has to gather RTCP candidates unless it wants
   to wait until receipt of an Answer that eventually confirms support
   or non-support for RTP and RTCP multiplexing.  In case the Offerer
   already sent RTCP candidates in a previous INFO request, it still
   needs to repeat them in subsequent INFO requests, even when that
   support for RTCP multiplexing was confirmed by the Answerer and the
   Offerer has released its RTCP candidates.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Considerations for Media Multiplexing</span>

   The following considerations describe options for Trickle ICE in
   order to give some guidance to implementers on how trickling can be
   optimized with respect to providing candidates in case of Media
   Multiplexing [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8843" title="&quot;Negotiating Media Multiplexing Using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC8843</a>].  It is assumed that the reader is familiar
   with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8843" title="&quot;Negotiating Media Multiplexing Using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC8843</a>].

   ICE candidate exchange is already considered in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8843#section-10">Section&nbsp;10 of
   [RFC8843]</a>.  These considerations are still valid for Trickle ICE;
   however, trickling provides more flexibility for the sequence of
   candidate exchange, especially in Full Trickle mode.

   Except for bundle-only &quot;m=&quot; lines, a Half Trickle Offerer has to send
   an Offer with candidates for all bundled &quot;m=&quot; lines.  The additional
   flexibility, however, allows a Full Trickle Offerer to initially send
   only candidates for the &quot;m=&quot; line with the suggested Offerer BUNDLE
   address.

   On receipt of the Answer, the Offerer will detect if BUNDLE is
   supported by the Answerer and if the suggested Offerer BUNDLE address
   was selected.  In this case, the Offerer does not need to trickle
   further candidates for the remaining &quot;m=&quot; lines in a bundle.
   However, if BUNDLE is not supported, the Full Trickle Offerer needs
   to gather and trickle candidates for the remaining &quot;m=&quot; lines as
   necessary.  If the Answerer selects an Offerer BUNDLE address that is
   different from the suggested Offerer BUNDLE address, the Full Trickle
   Offerer needs to gather and trickle candidates for the &quot;m=&quot; line that
   carries the selected Offerer BUNDLE address.

   A Trickle Answerer SHOULD include a &quot;group:BUNDLE&quot; attribute
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8843" title="&quot;Negotiating Media Multiplexing Using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC8843</a>] at session level in the &quot;application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag&quot;
   body if it supports and uses bundling.  When doing so, the Answerer
   MUST include all identification-tags in the same order that is used
   or will be used in the Answer.

   Receipt of this attribute at the Offerer in an INFO request prior to
   the Answer indicates that the Answerer supports and uses bundling.
   The Offerer can use this information, e.g., for stopping the
   gathering of candidates for the remaining &quot;m=&quot; lines in a bundle and/
   or for freeing corresponding resources.

   This behavior is illustrated by the following example Offer that
   indicates support for Media Multiplexing.

   If the Offerer already sent candidates for &quot;m=&quot; lines in a bundle in
   a previous INFO request, it still needs to repeat them in subsequent
   INFO requests, even when that support for bundling was confirmed by
   the Answerer and the Offerer has released candidates that are no
   longer needed.

   The example Offer indicates support for RTP and RTCP multiplexing and
   contains a &quot;candidate&quot; attribute only for the &quot;m=&quot; line with the
   suggested Offerer BUNDLE address.  Once the dialog is established as
   described in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>, the Answerer sends the following INFO
   request.

      INFO sip:alice@example.com SIP/2.0
      ...

      a=rtcp-mux
      a=candidate:1 1 UDP 1658497328 2001:db8:a0b:12f0::3 5000 typ host

   This INFO request indicates that the Answerer supports and uses Media
   Multiplexing as well.  Note that the Answerer only includes a single
   pseudo &quot;m=&quot; line since candidates matching those from the second &quot;m=&quot;
   line in the offer are not needed from the Answerer.

   The INFO request also indicates that the Answerer accepted the
   suggested Offerer BUNDLE address.  This allows the Offerer to omit
   gathering RTP and RTCP candidates for the other &quot;m=&quot; lines or
   releasing already gathered candidates.  If the INFO request did not
   contain the &quot;group:BUNDLE&quot; attribute, the Offerer has to gather RTP
   and RTCP candidates for the other &quot;m=&quot; lines unless it wants to wait
   until receipt of an Answer that eventually confirms support or non-
   support for Media Multiplexing.

   Independent of using Full Trickle or Half Trickle mode, the rules
   from [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8859" title="&quot;A Framework for Session Description Protocol (SDP) Attributes When Multiplexing&quot;">RFC8859</a>] apply to both, Offerer and Answerer, when putting
   attributes as specified in <a href="#section-9.2">Section 9.2</a> in the &quot;application/trickle-
   ice-sdpfrag&quot; body.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  SDP &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; Attribute</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-8.1" href="#section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Definition</span>

   This section defines the new SDP media-level and session-level
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4566" title="&quot;SDP: Session Description Protocol&quot;">RFC4566</a>] &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attribute. &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; is a
   property attribute [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4566" title="&quot;SDP: Session Description Protocol&quot;">RFC4566</a>]; hence, it has no value.  By including
   this attribute in an Offer or Answer, the sending agent indicates
   that it will not trickle further candidates.  When included at the
   session level, this indication applies to the whole session; when
   included at the media level, the indication applies only to the
   corresponding media description.

      Name:  end-of-candidates

      Value:  N/A

      Usage Level:  media and session level

      Charset Dependent:  no

      Mux Category:  IDENTICAL

      Example:  a=end-of-candidates

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-8.2" href="#section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Offer/Answer Procedures</span>

   The Offerer or Answerer MAY include an &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attribute
   in case candidate discovery has ended and no further candidates are
   to be trickled.  The Offerer or Answerer MUST provide the &quot;end-of-
   candidates&quot; attribute together with the &quot;ice-ufrag&quot; and &quot;ice-pwd&quot;
   attributes of the current ICE generation as required by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8838" title="&quot;Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol&quot;">RFC8838</a>].
   When included at the session level, this indication applies to the
   whole session; when included at the media level, the indication
   applies only to the corresponding media description.

   Receipt of an &quot;end-of-candidates&quot; attribute at an Offerer or Answerer
   -- with the &quot;ice-ufrag&quot; and &quot;ice-pwd&quot; attributes matching the current
   ICE generation -- indicates that the gathering of candidates has
   ended at the peer, for either the session or only the corresponding
   media description as specified above.  The receiving agent forwards

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-9.1" href="#section-9.1">9.1</a>.  Overall Description</span>

   An &quot;application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag&quot; body is used exclusively by the
   &quot;trickle-ice&quot; Info Package.  Other SDP-related applications need to
   define their own media type.  The INFO request body uses a subset of
   the possible SDP lines as defined by the grammar in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4566" title="&quot;SDP: Session Description Protocol&quot;">RFC4566</a>].  A
   valid body uses only pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines and certain attributes that
   are needed and/or useful for trickling candidates.  The content
   adheres to the following grammar.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-9.2" href="#section-9.2">9.2</a>.  Grammar</span>

   The grammar of an &quot;application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag&quot; body is based on
   the following ABNF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5234" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>].  It specifies the subset of existing
   SDP attributes that is needed or useful for trickling candidates.
   The grammar uses the indicator for case-sensitive %s, as defined in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7405" title="&quot;Case-Sensitive String Support in ABNF&quot;">RFC7405</a>], but it also imports grammar for other SDP attributes that
   precede the production of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7405" title="&quot;Case-Sensitive String Support in ABNF&quot;">RFC7405</a>].  A sender SHOULD use lower case
   for attributes from such earlier grammar, but a receiver MUST treat
   them as case insensitive.

   in their corresponding RFCs and are reproduced here.

   The &quot;ice-pwd&quot; and &quot;ice-ufrag&quot; attributes MUST appear at the same
   level as the ones in the Offer/Answer exchange.  In other words, if
   they were present as session-level attributes, they will also appear
   at the beginning of all INFO request payloads, i.e., preceding all
   pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines.  If they were originally exchanged as media-level
   attributes, potentially overriding session-level values, then they
   will also be included in INFO request payloads following the
   corresponding pseudo &quot;m=&quot; lines.

   An Agent MUST ignore any received unknown extension-attribute-fields.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-10" href="#section-10">10</a>.  Info Package</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.1" href="#section-10.1">10.1</a>.  Rationale -- Why INFO?</span>

   The decision to use SIP INFO requests as a candidate transport method
   is based primarily on their lightweight nature.  Once a dialog has
   been established, INFO requests can be exchanged both ways with no
   restrictions on timing and frequency and no risk of collision.

   A critical fact is that the sending of Trickle ICE candidates in one
   direction is entirely uncoupled from sending candidates in the other
   direction.  Thus, the sending of candidates in each direction can be
   done by a stream of INFO requests that is not correlated with the
   stream of INFO requests in the other direction.  And since each INFO
   request cumulatively includes the contents of all previous INFO
   requests in that direction, the ordering between INFO requests need
   not be preserved.  All of this permits using largely independent INFO
   requests.

   Contrarily, UPDATE or other Offer/Answer mechanisms assume that the
   messages in each direction are tightly coupled with messages in the
   other direction.  Using Offer/Answer and UPDATE requests [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3311" title="&quot;The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) UPDATE Method&quot;">RFC3311</a>]
   would introduce the following complications:

   Blocking of messages:  Offer/Answer is defined as a strictly
      sequential mechanism in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3264" title="&quot;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)&quot;">RFC3264</a>].  There can only be a maximum of
      one active exchange at any point of time.  Both sides cannot
      simultaneously send Offers nor can they generate multiple Offers
      prior to receiving an Answer.  Using UPDATE requests for candidate
      transport would therefore imply the implementation of a candidate
      pool at every agent where candidates can be stored until it is
      once again that agent&#x27;s &quot;turn&quot; to emit an Answer or a new Offer.
      Such an approach would introduce non-negligible complexity for no
      additional value.

   Elevated risk of glare:  The sequential nature of Offer/Answer also
      makes it impossible for both sides to send Offers simultaneously.
      What&#x27;s worse is that there are no mechanisms in SIP to actually
      prevent that.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3261" title="&quot;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol&quot;">RFC3261</a>], where the situation of Offers crossing
      on the wire is described as &quot;glare&quot;, only defines a procedure for
      addressing the issue after it has occurred.  According to that
      procedure, both Offers are invalidated and both sides need to
      retry the negotiation after a period between 0 and 4 seconds.  The
      high likelihood for glare and the average two-second backoff
      intervals to occur implies that the duration of Trickle ICE
      processing would not only fail to improve but actually exceed
      those of regular ICE.

   INFO messages decouple the exchange of candidates from the Offer/
   Answer negotiation and are subject to none of the glare issues
   described above, which makes them a very convenient and lightweight
   mechanism for asynchronous delivery of candidates.

   Using in-dialog INFO messages also provides a way of guaranteeing
   that candidates are delivered end to end, between the same entities
   that are actually in the process of initiating a session.  Out-of-
   dialog alternatives would have implied requiring support for GRUU
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5627" title="&quot;Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)&quot;">RFC5627</a>] that, given GRUUs relatively low adoption levels, would
   have constituted too strong of a constraint to the adoption of
   Trickle ICE.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.2" href="#section-10.2">10.2</a>.  Overall Description</span>

   This specification defines an Info Package for use by SIP UAs
   implementing Trickle ICE.  INFO requests carry ICE candidates
   discovered after the peer UAs have confirmed mutual support for
   Trickle ICE.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.3" href="#section-10.3">10.3</a>.  Applicability</span>

   The purpose of the ICE protocol is to establish a media path in the
   presence of NAT and firewalls.  The candidates are transported in
   INFO requests and are part of this establishment.

   Candidates sent by a Trickle ICE Agent after the Offer follow the
   same signaling path and reach the same entity as the Offer itself.
   While it is true that GRUUs can be used to achieve this, one of the
   goals of this specification is to allow operation of Trickle ICE in
   as many environments as possible including those without GRUU
   support.  Using out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY requests would not
   satisfy this goal.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.4" href="#section-10.4">10.4</a>.  Info Package Name</span>

   This document defines a SIP Info Package as per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6086" title="&quot;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework&quot;">RFC6086</a>].  The Info
   Package token name for this package is &quot;trickle-ice&quot;.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.5" href="#section-10.5">10.5</a>.  Info Package Parameters</span>

   This document does not define any Info Package parameters.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.6" href="#section-10.6">10.6</a>.  SIP Option Tags</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC6086">RFC6086</a>] allows Info Package specifications to define SIP option-
   tags.  This specification extends the option-tag construct of the SIP
   grammar as follows:

    option-tag /= &quot;trickle-ice&quot;

   SIP entities that support this specification MUST place the &quot;trickle-
   ice&quot; option-tag in a SIP Supported: or Require: header field within
   all SIP INVITE requests and responses.

   When responding to, or generating, a SIP OPTIONS request, a SIP
   entity MUST also include the &quot;trickle-ice&quot; option-tag in a SIP
   Supported: or Require: header field.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.7" href="#section-10.7">10.7</a>.  INFO Request Body Parts</span>

   Entities implementing this specification MUST include a payload of
   type &quot;application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag&quot; in SIP INFO requests as
   defined in <a href="#section-9.2">Section 9.2</a>.  The payload is used to convey SDP-encoded
   ICE candidates.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.8" href="#section-10.8">10.8</a>.  Info Package Usage Restrictions</span>

   This document does not define any Info Package Usage Restrictions.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.9" href="#section-10.9">10.9</a>.  Rate of INFO Requests</span>

   Given that IP addresses may be gathered rapidly, a Trickle ICE Agent
   with many network interfaces might create a high rate of INFO
   requests if every newly detected candidate is trickled individually
   without aggregation.  An implementation MUST aggregate ICE candidates
   in case an unreliable transport protocol such as UDP is used.  A
   Trickle ICE Agent MUST NOT have more than one INFO request pending at
   any one time.  When INFO messages are sent over an unreliable
   transport, they are retransmitted according to the rules specified in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc3261#section-17.1.2.1">[RFC3261], Section&nbsp;17.1.2.1</a>.

   If the INFO requests are sent on top of TCP, which is probably the
   standard way, it is not an issue for the network anymore, but it can
   remain one for SIP proxies and other intermediaries forwarding the
   SIP INFO messages.  Also, an endpoint may not be able to tell that it
   has congestion controlled transport all the way.

   See <a href="#section-13">Section 13</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-11" href="#section-11">11</a>.  Deployment Considerations</span>

   Trickle ICE uses two mechanisms for the exchange of candidate
   information.  This imposes new requirements to certain middleboxes
   that are used in some networks, e.g., for monitoring purposes.  While
   the first mechanism, SDP Offers and Answers, is already used by
   regular ICE and is assumed to be supported, the second mechanism,
   INFO request bodies, needs to be considered by such middleboxes as
   well when trickle ICE is used.  Such middleboxes need to make sure
   that they remain in the signaling path of the INFO requests and
   understand the INFO request body.
