   <span class="h1">OSPF Routing with Cross-Address Family Traffic Engineering Tunnels</span>

Abstract

   When using Traffic Engineering (TE) in a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
   network, the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE Label Switched
   Path (LSP) infrastructure may be duplicated, even if the destination
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses belong to the same remote router.  In order
   to achieve an integrated MPLS TE LSP infrastructure, OSPF routes must
   be computed over MPLS TE tunnels created using information propagated
   in another OSPF instance.  This issue is solved by advertising cross-
   address family (X-AF) OSPF TE information.

   This document describes an update to <a href="/doc/html/rfc5786">RFC 5786</a> that allows for the
   easy identification of a router&#x27;s local X-AF IP addresses.

   TE extensions to OSPFv2 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3630" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2&quot;">RFC3630</a>] and OSPFv3 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5329" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF Version 3&quot;">RFC5329</a>] have been
   described to support intra-area TE in IPv4 and IPv6 networks,
   respectively.  In both cases, the TE database provides a tight
   coupling between the routed protocol and advertised TE signaling
   information.  In other words, any use of the TE database is limited
   to IPv4 for OSPFv2 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2328" title="&quot;OSPF Version 2&quot;">RFC2328</a>] and IPv6 for OSPFv3 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5340" title="&quot;OSPF for IPv6&quot;">RFC5340</a>].

   In a dual-stack network, it may be desirable to set up common MPLS TE
   LSPs to carry traffic destined to addresses from different address
   families on a router.  The use of common LSPs eases potential
   scalability and management concerns by halving the number of LSPs in
   the network.  Besides, it allows operators to group traffic based on
   business characteristics, class of service, and/or applications; the
   operators are not constrained by the network protocol used.

   For example, an LSP created based on MPLS TE information propagated
   by an OSPFv2 instance can be used to transport both IPv4 and IPv6
   traffic, as opposed to using both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 to provision a
   separate LSP for each address family.  Even if, in some cases, the
   address-family-specific traffic is to be separated, calculation from
   a common TE database may prove to be operationally beneficial.

   During the SPF calculation on the TE tunnel head-end router, OSPF
   computes shortcut routes using TE tunnels.  A commonly used algorithm
   for computing shortcuts is defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3906" title="&quot;Calculating Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Routes Over Traffic Engineering Tunnels&quot;">RFC3906</a>].  For that or any
   similar algorithm to work with a common MPLS TE infrastructure in a
   dual-stack network, a requirement is to reliably map the X-AF
   addresses to the corresponding tail-end router.  This mapping is a
   challenge because the Link State Advertisements (LSAs) containing the
   routing information are carried in one OSPF instance, while the TE
   calculations may be done using a TE database from a different OSPF
   instance.

   A simple solution to this problem is to rely on the Router ID to
   identify a node in the corresponding OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 Link State
   Databases (LSDBs).  This solution would mandate both instances on the
   same router to be configured with the same Router ID.  However,
   relying on the correctness of configuration puts additional burden
   and cost on the operation of the network.  The network becomes even
   more difficult to manage if OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 topologies do not match
   exactly, for example, if area borders are chosen differently in the
   two protocols.  Also, if the routing processes do fall out of sync
   (e.g., having different Router IDs for local administrative reasons),
   there is no defined way for other routers to discover such
   misalignment and to take corrective measures (such as to avoid
   routing traffic through affected TE tunnels or alerting the network
   administrators).  The use of misaligned Router IDs may result in
   delivering the traffic to the wrong tail-end router, which could lead
   to suboptimal routing or even traffic loops.

   This document describes an update to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>] that allows for the
   easy identification of a router&#x27;s local X-AF IP addresses.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>]
   defined the Node IPv4 Local Address and Node IPv6 Local Address sub-
   TLVs of the Node Attribute TLV for a router to advertise additional
   local IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  However, [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>] did not describe
   the advertisement and usage of these sub-TLVs when the address family
   of the advertised local address differed from the address family of
   the OSPF traffic engineering protocol.

   This document updates [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>] so that a router can also announce
   one or more local X-AF addresses using the corresponding Local
   Address sub-TLV.  Routers using the Node Attribute TLV [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>] can
   include non-TE-enabled interface addresses in their OSPF TE
   advertisements and also use the same sub-TLVs to carry X-AF
   information, facilitating the mapping described above.

   The method specified in this document can also be used to compute the
   X-AF mapping of the egress Label Switching Router (LSR) for sub-LSPs
   of a Point-to-Multipoint LSP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4461" title="&quot;Signaling Requirements for Point-to- Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)&quot;">RFC4461</a>].  Considerations of using
   Point-to-Multipoint MPLS TE for X-AF traffic forwarding is outside
   the scope of this document.

   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Operation</span>

   To implement the X-AF routing technique described in this document,
   OSPFv2 will advertise the Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLV and OSPFv3
   will advertise the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV, possibly in
   addition to advertising other IP addresses as documented by
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>].

   Multiple instances of OSPFv3 are needed if it is used for both IPv4
   and IPv6 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5838" title="&quot;Support of Address Families in OSPFv3&quot;">RFC5838</a>].  The operation in this section is described with
   OSPFv2 as the protocol used for IPv4; that is the most common case.
   The case of OSPFv3 being used for IPv4 follows the same procedure as
   what is indicated for OSPFv2 below.

   On a node that implements X-AF routing, each OSPF instance
   advertises, using the Node Local Address sub-TLV, all X-AF IPv6 (for
   OSPFv2 instance) or IPv4 (for OSPFv3) addresses local to the router
   that can be used by the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) to
   calculate MPLS TE LSPs:

   *  The OSPF instance MUST advertise the IP address listed in the
      Router Address TLV [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3630" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2&quot;">RFC3630</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5329" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF Version 3&quot;">RFC5329</a>] of the X-AF instance
      maintaining the TE database.

   *  The OSPF instance SHOULD include additional local addresses
      advertised by the X-AF OSPF instance in its Node Local Address
      sub-TLVs.

   *  An implementation MAY advertise other local X-AF addresses.

   When TE information is advertised in an OSPF instance, both natively
   (i.e., as per RFC [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3630" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2&quot;">RFC3630</a>] or [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5329" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF Version 3&quot;">RFC5329</a>]) and as X-AF Node Attribute
   TLV, it is left to local configuration to determine which TE database
   is used to compute routes for the OSPF instance.

   On Area Border Routers (ABRs), each advertised X-AF IP address MUST
   be advertised into, at most, one area.  If OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 ABRs
   coincide (i.e., the areas for all OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 interfaces are
   the same), then the X-AF addresses MUST be advertised into the same
   area in both instances.  This allows other ABRs connected to the same
   set of areas to know with which area to associate computed MPLS TE
   tunnels.

   During the X-AF routing calculation, X-AF IP addresses are used to
   map locally created LSPs to tail-end routers in the LSDB.  The
   mapping algorithm can be described as:

      Walk the list of all MPLS TE tunnels for which the computing
      router is a head end.  For each MPLS TE tunnel T:

      1.  If T&#x27;s destination address is from the same address family as
          the OSPF instance associated with the LSDB, then the
          extensions defined in this document do not apply.

      2.  Otherwise, it is a X-AF MPLS TE tunnel.  Note the tunnel&#x27;s
          destination IP address.

      3.  Walk the X-AF IP addresses in the LSDBs of all connected
          areas.  If a matching IP address is found, advertised by
          router R in area A, then mark the tunnel T as belonging to
          area A and terminating on tail-end router R.  Assign the
          intra-area SPF cost to reach router R within area A as the IGP
          cost of tunnel T.

   After completing this calculation, each TE tunnel is associated with
   an area and tail-end router in terms of the routing LSDB of the
   computing OSPF instance and has a cost.

   The algorithm described above is to be used only if the Node Local
   Address sub-TLV includes X-AF information.

   Note that, for clarity of description, the mapping algorithm is
   specified as a single calculation.  Implementations may choose to
   support equivalent mapping functionality without implementing the
   algorithm as described.

   As an example, consider a router in a dual-stack network using OSPFv2
   and OSPFv3 for IPv4 and IPv6 routing, respectively.  Suppose the
   OSPFv2 instance is used to propagate MPLS TE information and the
   router is configured to accept TE LSPs terminating at local addresses
   198.51.100.1 and 198.51.100.2.  The router advertises in OSPFv2 the
   IPv4 address 198.51.100.1 in the Router Address TLV, the additional
   local IPv4 address 198.51.100.2 in the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-
   TLV, and other TE TLVs as required by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3630" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2&quot;">RFC3630</a>].  If the OSPFv3
   instance in the network is enabled for X-AF TE routing (that is, to
   use MPLS TE LSPs computed by OSPFv2 for IPv6 routing), then the
   OSPFv3 instance of the router will advertise the Node IPv4 Local
   Address sub-TLV listing the local IPv4 addresses 198.51.100.1 and
   198.51.100.2.  Other routers in the OSPFv3 network will use this
   information to reliably identify this router as the egress LSR for
   MPLS TE LSPs terminating at either 198.51.100.1 or 198.51.100.2.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Backward Compatibility</span>

   Only routers that serve as endpoints for one or more TE tunnels MUST
   be upgraded to support the procedures described herein:

   *  Tunnel tail-end routers advertise the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-
      TLV and/or the Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLV.

   *  Tunnel head-end routers perform the X-AF routing calculation.

   Both the endpoints MUST be upgraded before the tail end starts
   advertising the X-AF information.  Other routers in the network do
   not need to support X-AF procedures.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Automatically Switched Optical Networks</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC6827">RFC6827</a>] updates [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>] by defining extensions to be used in an
   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).  The Local TE Router
   ID sub-TLV is required for determining ASON reachability.  The
   implication is that if the Local TE Router ID sub-TLV is present in
   the Node Attribute TLV, then the procedures in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6827" title="&quot;Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) Routing for OSPFv2 Protocols&quot;">RFC6827</a>] apply,
   regardless of whether any X-AF information is advertised.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document describes the use of the Local Address sub-TLVs to
   provide X-AF information.  The advertisement of these sub-TLVs, in
   any OSPF instance, is not precluded by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>].  As such, no new
   security threats are introduced beyond the considerations in OSPFv2
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2328" title="&quot;OSPF Version 2&quot;">RFC2328</a>], OSPFv3 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5340" title="&quot;OSPF for IPv6&quot;">RFC5340</a>], and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5786" title="&quot;Advertising a Router&#x27;s Local Addresses in OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions&quot;">RFC5786</a>].

   The X-AF information is not used for SPF computation or normal
   routing, so the mechanism specified here has no effect on IP routing.
   However, generating incorrect information or tampering with the sub-
   TLVs may have an effect on traffic engineering computations.
   Specifically, TE traffic may be delivered to the wrong tail-end
   router, which could lead to suboptimal routing, traffic loops, or
   exposing the traffic to attacker inspection or modification.  These
   threats are already present in other TE-related specifications, and
   their considerations apply here as well, including [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3630" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2&quot;">RFC3630</a>] and
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5329" title="&quot;Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF Version 3&quot;">RFC5329</a>].
