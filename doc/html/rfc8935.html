       <span class="h1">Push-Based Security Event Token (SET) Delivery Using HTTP</span>

Abstract

   This specification defines how a Security Event Token (SET) can be
   delivered to an intended recipient using HTTP POST over TLS.  The SET
   is transmitted in the body of an HTTP POST request to an endpoint
   operated by the recipient, and the recipient indicates successful or
   failed transmission via the HTTP response.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction and Overview</span>

   This specification defines a mechanism by which a transmitter of a
   Security Event Token (SET) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8417" title="&quot;Security Event Token (SET)&quot;">RFC8417</a>] can deliver the SET to an
   intended SET Recipient via HTTP POST [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7231" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content&quot;">RFC7231</a>] over TLS.  This is an
   alternative SET delivery method to the one defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8936" title="&quot;Poll-Based Security Event Token (SET) Delivery Using HTTP&quot;">RFC8936</a>].

   Push-based SET delivery over HTTP POST is intended for scenarios
   where all of the following apply:

   *  The transmitter of the SET is capable of making outbound HTTP
      requests.

   *  The recipient is capable of hosting a TLS-enabled HTTP endpoint
      that is accessible to the transmitter.

   *  The transmitter and recipient are willing to exchange data with
      one another.

   In some scenarios, either push-based or poll-based delivery could be
   used, and in others, only one of them would be applicable.

   A mechanism for exchanging configuration metadata such as endpoint
   URLs, cryptographic keys, and possible implementation constraints
   such as buffer size limitations between the transmitter and recipient
   is out of scope for this specification.  How SETs are defined and the
   process by which security events are identified for SET Recipients
   are specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8417" title="&quot;Security Event Token (SET)&quot;">RFC8417</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Notational Conventions</span>

   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   line wrapping for readability and due to space limitations.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Definitions</span>

   This specification utilizes the following terms defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8417" title="&quot;Security Event Token (SET)&quot;">RFC8417</a>]:
   &quot;Security Event Token (SET)&quot;, &quot;SET Issuer&quot;, &quot;SET Recipient&quot;, and
   &quot;Event Payload&quot;, as well as the term defined below:

   SET Transmitter:  An entity that delivers SETs in its possession to
      one or more SET Recipients.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  SET Delivery</span>

   To deliver a SET to a given SET Recipient, the SET Transmitter makes
   a SET Transmission Request to the SET Recipient, with the SET itself
   contained within the request.  The SET Recipient replies to this
   request with a response either acknowledging successful transmission
   of the SET or indicating that an error occurred while receiving,
   parsing, and/or validating the SET.

   Upon receipt of a SET, the SET Recipient SHALL validate that all of
   the following are true:

   *  The SET Recipient can parse the SET.

   *  The SET is authentic (i.e., it was issued by the issuer specified
      within the SET, and if signed, was signed by a key belonging to
      the issuer).

   *  The SET Recipient is identified as an intended audience of the
      SET.

   *  The SET Issuer is recognized as an issuer that the SET Recipient
      is willing to receive SETs from (e.g., the issuer is listed as
      allowed by the SET Recipient).

   *  The SET Recipient is willing to accept this SET from this SET
      Transmitter (e.g., the SET Transmitter is expected to send SETs
      with the issuer and subject of the SET in question).

   The mechanisms by which the SET Recipient performs this validation
   are out of scope for this document.  SET parsing, issuer
   identification, and audience identification are defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8417" title="&quot;Security Event Token (SET)&quot;">RFC8417</a>].
   The mechanism for validating the authenticity of a SET is deployment
   specific and may vary depending on the authentication mechanisms in
   use and whether the SET is signed and/or encrypted (See <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).

   SET Transmitters MAY transmit SETs issued by another entity.  The SET
   Recipient may accept or reject (i.e., return an error response such
   as &quot;access_denied&quot;) a SET at its own discretion.

   The SET Recipient persists the SET in a way that is sufficient to
   meet the SET Recipient&#x27;s own reliability requirements.  The level and
   method of retention of SETs by SET Recipients is out of scope of this
   specification.  Once the SET has been validated and persisted, the
   SET Recipient SHOULD immediately return a response indicating that
   the SET was successfully delivered.  The SET Recipient SHOULD NOT
   perform further processing of the SET beyond the required validation
   steps prior to sending this response.  Any additional steps SHOULD be
   executed asynchronously from delivery to minimize the time the SET
   Transmitter is waiting for a response.

   The SET Transmitter MAY transmit the same SET to the SET Recipient
   multiple times, regardless of the response from the SET Recipient.
   The SET Recipient MUST respond as it would if the SET had not been
   previously received by the SET Recipient.  The SET Recipient MUST NOT
   expect or depend on a SET Transmitter to retransmit a SET or
   otherwise make a SET available to the SET Recipient once the SET
   Recipient acknowledges that it was received successfully.

   The SET Transmitter should not retransmit a SET unless the SET
   Transmitter suspects that previous transmissions may have failed due
   to potentially recoverable errors (such as network outage or
   temporary service interruption at either the SET Transmitter or SET
   Recipient).  In all other cases, the SET Transmitter SHOULD NOT
   retransmit a SET.  The SET Transmitter SHOULD delay retransmission
   for an appropriate amount of time to avoid overwhelming the SET
   Recipient (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Transmitting a SET</span>

   To transmit a SET to a SET Recipient, the SET Transmitter makes an
   HTTP POST request to a TLS-enabled HTTP endpoint provided by the SET
   Recipient.  The &quot;Content-Type&quot; header field of this request MUST be
   &quot;application/secevent+jwt&quot; as defined in Sections <a href="#section-2.3">2.3</a> and <a href="#section-7.2">7.2</a> of
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8417" title="&quot;Security Event Token (SET)&quot;">RFC8417</a>], and the &quot;Accept&quot; header field MUST be &quot;application/json&quot;.
   The request body MUST consist of the SET itself, represented as a
   JSON Web Token (JWT) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7519" title="&quot;JSON Web Token (JWT)&quot;">RFC7519</a>].

   The SET Transmitter MAY include in the request an &quot;Accept-Language&quot;
   header field to indicate to the SET Recipient the preferred
   language(s) in which to receive error messages.

   The mechanisms by which the SET Transmitter determines the HTTP
   endpoint to use when transmitting a SET to a given SET Recipient are
   not defined by this specification and are deployment specific.

   The following is a non-normative example of a SET Transmission
   Request:

     POST /Events HTTP/1.1
     Host: notify.rp.example.com
     Accept: application/json
     Accept-Language: en-US, en;q=0.5
     Content-Type: application/secevent+jwt

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Success Response</span>

   If the SET is determined to be valid, the SET Recipient SHALL
   acknowledge successful transmission by responding with HTTP Response
   Status Code 202 (Accepted) (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.3">Section&nbsp;6.3.3 of [RFC7231]</a>).  The
   body of the response MUST be empty.

   The following is a non-normative example of a successful receipt of a
   SET.

     HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.3" href="#section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Failure Response</span>

   In the event of a general HTTP error condition, the SET Recipient
   responds with the applicable HTTP Status Code, as defined in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6">Section&nbsp;6 of [RFC7231]</a>.

   When the SET Recipient detects an error parsing, validating, or
   authenticating a SET transmitted in a SET Transmission Request, the
   SET Recipient SHALL respond with an HTTP Response Status Code of 400
   (Bad Request).  The &quot;Content-Type&quot; header field of this response MUST
   be &quot;application/json&quot;, and the body MUST be a UTF-8 encoded JSON
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>] object containing the following name/value pairs:

   err:  A Security Event Token Error Code (see <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>).

   description:  A UTF-8 string containing a human-readable description
      of the error that may provide additional diagnostic information.
      The exact content of this field is implementation specific.

   The response MUST include a &quot;Content-Language&quot; header field whose
   value indicates the language of the error descriptions included in
   the response body.  If the SET Recipient can provide error
   descriptions in multiple languages, they SHOULD choose the language
   to use according to the value of the &quot;Accept-Language&quot; header field
   sent by the SET Transmitter in the transmission request, as described
   in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5">Section&nbsp;5.3.5 of [RFC7231]</a>.  If the SET Transmitter did not send
   an &quot;Accept-Language&quot; header field, or if the SET Recipient does not
   support any of the languages included in the header field, the SET
   Recipient MUST respond with messages that are understandable by an
   English-speaking person, as described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2277#section-4.5">Section&nbsp;4.5 of [RFC2277]</a>.

   The following is a non-normative example error response indicating
   that the key used to encrypt the SET has been revoked.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.4" href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Security Event Token Error Codes</span>

   Security Event Token Error Codes are strings that identify a specific
   category of error that may occur when parsing or validating a SET.
   Every Security Event Token Error Code MUST have a unique name
   registered in the IANA &quot;Security Event Token Error Codes&quot; registry
   established by <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

   The following table presents the initial set of Error Codes that are
   registered in the IANA &quot;Security Event Token Error Codes&quot; registry:

      +=======================+=====================================+
      | Error Code            | Description                         |

                          Table 1: SET Error Codes

   Other Error Codes may also be received, as the set of Error Codes is
   extensible via the IANA &quot;Security Event Token Error Codes&quot; registry
   established in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Authentication and Authorization</span>

   The SET delivery method described in this specification is based upon
   HTTP over TLS [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2818" title="&quot;HTTP Over TLS&quot;">RFC2818</a>] and standard HTTP authentication and
   authorization schemes, as per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7235" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication&quot;">RFC7235</a>].  The TLS server certificate
   MUST be validated using DNS-ID [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6125" title="&quot;Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)&quot;">RFC6125</a>] and/or DNS-Based
   Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6698" title="&quot;The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA&quot;">RFC6698</a>].

   Authorization for the eligibility to provide actionable SETs can be
   determined by using the identity of the SET Issuer, the identity of
   the SET Transmitter, perhaps using mutual TLS, or via other employed
   authentication methods.  Because SETs are not commands, SET
   Recipients are free to ignore SETs that are not of interest.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Delivery Reliability</span>

   Delivery reliability requirements may vary depending upon the use
   cases.  This specification defines the response from the SET
   Recipient in such a way as to provide the SET Transmitter with the
   information necessary to determine what further action is required,
   if any, in order to meet their requirements.  SET Transmitters with
   high reliability requirements may be tempted to always retry failed
   transmissions.  However, it should be noted that for many types of
   SET delivery errors, a retry is extremely unlikely to be successful.
   For example, &quot;invalid_request&quot; indicates a structural error in the
   content of the request body that is likely to remain when
   retransmitting the same SET.  Others such as &quot;access_denied&quot; may be
   transient, for example, if the SET Transmitter refreshes expired
   credentials prior to retransmission.

   The SET Transmitter may be unaware of whether or not a SET has been
   delivered to a SET Recipient.  For example, a network interruption
   could prevent the SET Transmitter from receiving the success
   response, or a service outage could prevent the SET Transmitter from
   recording the fact that the SET was delivered.  It is left to the
   implementer to decide how to handle such cases, based on their
   requirements.  For example, it may be appropriate for the SET
   Transmitter to retransmit the SET to the SET Recipient, erring on the
   side of guaranteeing delivery, or it may be appropriate to assume
   delivery was successful, erring on the side of not spending resources
   retransmitting previously delivered SETs.  Other options, such as
   sending the SET to a &quot;dead letter queue&quot; for manual examination may
   also be appropriate.

   Implementers SHOULD evaluate the reliability requirements of their
   use cases and the impact of various retry mechanisms and
   retransmission policies on the performance of their systems to
   determine an appropriate strategy for handling various error
   conditions.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Authentication Using Signed SETs</span>

   JWS signed SETs can be used (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7515" title="&quot;JSON Web Signature (JWS)&quot;">RFC7515</a>] and <a href="/doc/html/rfc8417#section-5">Section&nbsp;5 of
   [RFC8417]</a>) to enable the SET Recipient to validate that the SET
   Issuer is authorized to provide actionable SETs.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  HTTP Considerations</span>

   SET delivery depends on the use of Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is
   thus subject to the security considerations of HTTP (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7230#section-9">Section&nbsp;9 of
   [RFC7230]</a>) and its related specifications.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Confidentiality of SETs</span>

   SETs may contain sensitive information, including Personally
   Identifiable Information (PII), or be distributed through third
   parties.  In such cases, SET Transmitters and SET Recipients MUST
   protect the confidentiality of the SET contents.  TLS MUST be used to
   secure the transmitted SETs.  In some use cases, encrypting the SET
   as described in JWE [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7516" title="&quot;JSON Web Encryption (JWE)&quot;">RFC7516</a>] will also be required.  The Event
   delivery endpoint MUST support at least TLS version 1.2 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5246" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2&quot;">RFC5246</a>] and
   SHOULD support the newest version of TLS that meets its security
   requirements, which as of the time of this publication is TLS 1.3
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8446" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">RFC8446</a>].  The client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server certificate
   check using DNS-ID [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6125" title="&quot;Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)&quot;">RFC6125</a>] and/or DANE [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6698" title="&quot;The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA&quot;">RFC6698</a>].  How a SET
   Transmitter determines the expected service identity to match the SET
   Recipient&#x27;s server certificate against is out of scope for this
   document.  The implementation security considerations for TLS in
   &quot;Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7525" title="&quot;Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)&quot;">RFC7525</a>] MUST be followed.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.4" href="#section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Denial of Service</span>

   The SET Recipient may be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack
   where a malicious party makes a high volume of requests containing
   invalid SETs, causing the endpoint to expend significant resources on
   cryptographic operations that are bound to fail.  This may be
   mitigated by authenticating SET Transmitters with a mechanism such as
   mutual TLS.  Rate-limiting problematic transmitters is also a
   possible means of mitigation.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.5" href="#section-5.5">5.5</a>.  Authenticating Persisted SETs</span>

   At the time of receipt, the SET Recipient can rely upon TLS
   mechanisms, HTTP authentication methods, and/or other context from
   the transmission request to authenticate the SET Transmitter and
   validate the authenticity of the SET.  However, this context is
   typically unavailable to systems to which the SET Recipient forwards
   the SET, or to systems that retrieve the SET from storage.  If the
   SET Recipient requires the ability to validate SET authenticity
   outside of the context of the transmission request, then the SET
   Recipient SHOULD ensure that such SETs have been signed in accordance
   with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7515" title="&quot;JSON Web Signature (JWS)&quot;">RFC7515</a>].  Needed context could also be stored with the SET and
   retrieved with it.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Privacy Considerations</span>

   SET Transmitters should attempt to deliver SETs that are targeted to
   the specific business and protocol needs of subscribers.

   When sharing personally identifiable information or information that
   is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, SET
   Transmitters and Recipients MUST have the appropriate legal
   agreements and user consent or terms of service in place.
   Furthermore, data that needs confidentiality protection MUST be
   encrypted, at least with TLS and sometimes also using JSON Web
   Encryption (JWE) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7516" title="&quot;JSON Web Encryption (JWE)&quot;">RFC7516</a>].

   In some cases, subject identifiers themselves may be considered
   sensitive information, such that their inclusion within a SET may be
   considered a violation of privacy.  SET Issuers and SET Transmitters
   should consider the ramifications of sharing a particular subject
   identifier with a SET Recipient (e.g., whether doing so could enable
   correlation and/or de-anonymization of data) and choose appropriate
   subject identifiers for their use cases.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Security Event Token Error Codes</span>

   This document defines Security Event Token Error Codes, for which
   IANA has created and now maintains a new registry titled &quot;Security
   Event Token Error Codes&quot;.  Initial values for the &quot;Security Event
   Token Error Codes&quot; registry are defined in Table 1 and registered
   below.  Future assignments are to be made through the Specification
   Required registration policy [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] and shall follow the template
   below.

   Error Codes are intended to be interpreted by automated systems;
   therefore, they SHOULD identify classes of errors to which an
   automated system could respond in a meaningfully distinct way (e.g.,
   by refreshing authentication credentials and retrying the request).

   Error Code names are case sensitive.  Names may not match other
   registered names in a case-insensitive manner unless the Designated
   Experts state that there is a compelling reason to allow an
   exception.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the
   registration description is clear.

   It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   expert, that expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   experts.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Unencrypted Transport Considerations</span>

   Earlier versions of this specification made the use of TLS optional
   and described security and privacy considerations resulting from use
   of unencrypted HTTP as the underlying transport.  When the working
   group decided to mandate usage of HTTP over TLS, it also decided to
   preserve the description of these considerations in this non-
   normative appendix.

   SETs may contain sensitive information that is considered Personally
   Identifiable Information (PII).  In such cases, SET Transmitters and
   SET Recipients MUST protect the confidentiality of the SET contents.
   When TLS is not used, this means that the SET MUST be encrypted as
   described in JWE [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7516" title="&quot;JSON Web Encryption (JWE)&quot;">RFC7516</a>].

   If SETs were allowed to be transmitted over unencrypted channels,
   some privacy-sensitive information about them might leak, even though
   the SETs themselves are encrypted.  For instance, an attacker may be
   able to determine whether or not a SET was accepted and the reason
   for its rejection or may be able to derive information from being
   able to observe the size of the encrypted SET.  (Note that even when
   TLS is utilized, some information leakage is still possible; message
   padding algorithms to prevent side channels remain an open research
   topic.)
