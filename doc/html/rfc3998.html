<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application level protocol
   that can be used for distributed printing using Internet tools and
   technologies.  IPP version 1.1 ([RFC2911, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2910">RFC2910</a>]) focuses on end-
   user functionality, with a few administrative operations included.
   This document defines additional OPTIONAL end user, operator, and
   administrator operations used to control Jobs and Printers.  In
   addition, this document extends the semantic model of the Printer
   object by allowing them to be configured into trees and/or inverted
   trees that represent Printer object Fan-Out and Printer object Fan-
   In, respectively.  The special case of a tree with only a single
   Subordinate node represents Chained Printers.  This document is a
   registration proposal for an extension to IPP/1.0 and IPP/1.1
   following the registration procedures in those documents.

   The requirements and use cases for this document are defined in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3239" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Requirements for Job, Printer, and Device Administrative Operations&quot;">RFC3239</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   This section defines the terminology used throughout this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Conformance Terminology</span>

   Capitalized terms such as MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD
   NOT, MAY, NEED NOT, and OPTIONAL have special meaning relating to
   conformance as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], <a href="#section-12.1">section</a>
   <a href="#section-12.1">12.1</a>.  If an implementation supports the extension defined in this
   document, then these terms apply; otherwise, they do not.  These
   terms define conformance to this document only; they do not affect
   conformance to other documents, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Other Terminology</span>

   This document uses terms such as &quot;client&quot;, &quot;Printer&quot;, &quot;Job&quot;,
   &quot;attributes&quot;, &quot;keywords&quot;, &quot;operation&quot;, and &quot;support&quot;.  These terms
   have special meaning and are defined in the model terminology
   (<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-12.2">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;12.2</a>).

   In addition, the following capitalized terms are defined:

   IPP Printer object (or Printer for short) - A software abstraction
   defined by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>].

   Printer Operation - An operation whose target is an IPP Printer
   object and whose effect is on the Printer object.

   Output Device - The physical imaging mechanism that an IPP Printer
   controls.  Note: although this term is capitalized in this
   specification (but not in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>]), there is no formal object
   called an Output Device defined in this document (or in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>]).

   Output Device Fan-Out - A configuration in which an IPP Printer
   controls more than one Output Device.

   Printer Fan-Out - A configuration in which an IPP Printer object
   controls more than one Subordinate IPP Printer object.

   Printer Fan-In - A configuration in which an IPP Printer object is
   controlled by more than one IPP Printer object.

   Subordinate Printer - An IPP Printer object that is controlled by
   another IPP Printer object.  Such a Subordinate Printer MAY have zero
   or more Subordinate Printers.

   Leaf Printer - An IPP Printer object that has no Subordinate
   Printers.

   Non-Leaf Printer - An IPP Printer object that has one or more
   Subordinate Printers.  A Non-Leaf Printer is also called a Parent
   Printer.

   Chained Printer - a Non-Leaf Printer that has exactly one Subordinate
   Printer.

   Job Creation operations - IPP operations that create a Job object:
   Print-Job, Print-URI, and Create-Job.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Definition of the Printer Operations</span>

   All Printer Operations are directed at Printer objects.  A client
   MUST always supply the &quot;printer-uri&quot; operation attribute in order to
   identify the correct target of the operation.  These descriptions
   assume all of the common semantics of the IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics
   document (<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.1">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.1</a>).

   The Printer Operations defined in this document are summarized in
   Table 1.

   Table 1.  Printer Operation Operation-Id Assignments

   Operation Name  Operation-Id  Brief Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   Enable-Printer      0x22      Allows the target Printer to accept
                                 Job Creation operations.

   Disable-Printer     0x23      Prevents the target Printer from
                                 accepting Job Creation operations.

   Pause-Printer-      0x24      Pauses the Printer after the current
   After-Current-                job has been sent to the Output
   Job                           Device.

   Hold-New-Jobs       0x25      Finishes processing all currently
                                 pending jobs.  Any new jobs are
                                 placed in the &#x27;pending-held&#x27; state.

   Release-Held-       0x26      Releases all jobs to the &#x27;pending&#x27;
   New-Jobs                      state that had been held by the
                                 effect of a previous Hold-New-Jobs
                                 operation and condition the Printer
                                 so that it no longer holds new jobs.

   Deactivate-         0x27      Puts the Printer into a read-only
   Printer                       deactivated state.

   Activate-           0x28      Restores the Printer to normal
   Printer                       activity.

   Restart-Printer     0x29      Restarts the target Printer and re-
                                 initializes the software.

   Shutdown-           0x2A      Shuts down the target Printer so that
   Printer                       it cannot be restarted or queried.

   Startup-Printer     0x2B      Starts up the instance of the Printer
                                 object.

   All of the operations in this document are OPTIONAL for an IPP object
   to support.  Unless the specification of an OPTIONAL operation
   requires support of another OPTIONAL operation, conforming
   implementations may support any combination of these operations.
   Many of the operations come in pairs, so both are REQUIRED if either
   one is implemented.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  The Disable and Enable Printer Operations</span>

   This section defines the OPTIONAL Disable-Printer and Enable-Printer
   operations that stop and start the IPP Printer object from accepting
   new IPP jobs.  If either of these operations are supported, both MUST
   be supported.

   These operations allow the operator to control whether the Printer
   will accept new Job Creation (Print-Job, Print-URI, and Create-Job)
   operations.  These operations have no other effect on the Printer, so
   the Printer continues to accept all other operations and continues to
   schedule and process jobs normally.  In other words, these operations
   control the &quot;input of new jobs&quot; to the IPP Printer, and the Pause and
   Resume operations (see <a href="#section-3.2">section 3.2</a>) independently control the &quot;output
   of new jobs&quot; from the IPP Printer to the Output Device.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.1" href="#section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Disable-Printer Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to stop the Printer object
   from accepting new jobs; i.e., it causes the Printer to reject
   subsequent Job Creation operations and return the &#x27;server-error-not-
   accepting-jobs&#x27; status code.  The Printer still accepts all other
   operations, including Validate-Job, Send-Document, and Send-URI
   operations.  Thus a Disable-Printer operation allows a client to
   continue submitting multiple documents of a multiple document job if
   the Create-Job operation had already been accepted.  All previously
   created or submitted Jobs and all Jobs currently processing continue
   unaffected.

   The IPP Printer MUST accept the request in any state.  The Printer
   sets the value of its &quot;printer-is-accepting-jobs&quot; READ-ONLY Printer
   Description attribute to &#x27;false&#x27; (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-4.4.20">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;4.4.20</a>), no
   matter what the previous value was.  This operation has no immediate
   or direct effect on the Printer&#x27;s &quot;printer-state&quot; and &quot;printer-
   state-reasons&quot; attributes.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)
   performing this operation must be an operator or administrator of the
   Printer object (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>] sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-8.5">8.5</a>).

   The Disable-Printer Request and Disable-Printer Response have the
   same attribute groups and attributes as do the Pause-Printer
   operation (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-3.2.7.1">3.2.7.1</a> and <a href="#section-3.2.7.2">3.2.7.2</a>), including
   the new &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; operation attribute (see
   <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.2" href="#section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Enable-Printer Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to start the Printer object
   accepting jobs; i.e., it causes the Printer to accept subsequent Job
   Creation operations.  The Printer still accepts all other operations.
   All previously submitted and currently processing Jobs continue
   unaffected.

   The IPP Printer MUST accept the request in any state.  The Printer
   sets the value of its &quot;printer-is-accepting-jobs&quot; READ-ONLY Printer
   Description attribute to &#x27;true&#x27; (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-4.4.20">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;4.4.20</a>), no
   matter what the previous value was.  This operation has no immediate
   or direct effect on the Printer&#x27;s &quot;printer-state&quot; and &quot;printer-
   state-reasons&quot; attributes.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)
   performing this operation must be an operator or administrator of the
   Printer object (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>] sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-8.5">8.5</a>).

   The Enable-Printer Request and Enable-Printer Response have the same
   attribute groups and attributes as does the Pause-Printer operation
   (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-3.2.8.1">3.2.8.1</a> and <a href="#section-3.2.8.2">3.2.8.2</a>), including the new
   &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; operation attribute (see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  The Pause and Resume Printer Operations</span>

   This section leaves the OPTIONAL IPP/1.1 Pause-Printer (see
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-3.2.7">3.2.7</a>) ambiguous as to whether it stops the
   Printer immediately or after the current job.  It also defines the
   OPTIONAL Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job operation as following the
   current job.  These operations affect the scheduling of IPP jobs.  If
   either of these Pause Printer operations are supported, then the
   Resume-Printer operation MUST be supported.

   These operations allow the operator to control whether the Printer
   will send new IPP jobs to the associated Output Device(s) that the
   IPP Printer object represents.  These operations have no other effect
   on the Printer, so the Printer continues to accept all operations.

   In other words, these operations control the &quot;output of new jobs&quot; to
   the Output Device(s), and the Disable and Enable Printer Operations
   (see <a href="#section-3.1">section 3.1</a>) independently control the &quot;input of new jobs&quot; to
   the IPP Printer.

   Table 2.  Pause and Resume Printer Operations

   Pause and Resume Printers  Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   IPP/1.1 Pause Printer      Stops the IPP Printer from sending
                              new IPP Jobs to the Output Device(s)
                              either immediately or after the
                              current job completes, depending on
                              implementation, as defined in
                              [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>].

   Pause-Printer-After-       Stops the IPP Printer from sending
   Current-Job                new IPP Jobs to the Output Device(s)
                              after the current jobs finish.

   Resume-Printer             Starts the IPP Printer sending IPP
                              Jobs to the Output Device again.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.1" href="#section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to stop the Printer object
   from sending IPP jobs to any of its Output Devices or Subordinate
   Printers.  If the IPP Printer is in the middle of sending an IPP job
   to an Output Device or Subordinate Printer, the IPP Printer MUST
   complete sending that Job.  However, after receiving this operation,
   the IPP Printer MUST NOT send any additional IPP jobs to any of its
   Output Devices or Subordinate Printers.  In addition, after having
   received this operation, the IPP Printer MUST NOT start processing
   any more jobs, so additional jobs MUST NOT enter the &#x27;processing&#x27;
   state.

   If the IPP Printer is not sending an IPP Job to the Output Device or
   Subordinate Printer (whether or not the Output Device or Subordinate
   Printer is busy processing any jobs), the IPP Printer object
   transitions immediately to the &#x27;stopped&#x27; state by setting its
   &quot;printer-state&quot; attribute to &#x27;stopped&#x27;, removing the &#x27;moving-to-
   paused&#x27; value, if present, from its &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot;
   attribute, and adding the &#x27;paused&#x27; value to its &quot;printer-state-
   reasons&quot; attribute.

   If the implementation will take appreciable time to complete sending
   an IPP job that it has started sending to an Output Device or
   Subordinate Printer, the IPP Printer adds the &#x27;moving-to-paused&#x27;

   value to the Printer object&#x27;s &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attribute (see
   section [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], 4.4.12).  When the IPP Printer has completed
   sending IPP jobs that it was in the process of sending, the Printer
   object transitions to the &#x27;stopped&#x27; state by setting its &quot;printer-
   state&quot; attribute to &#x27;stopped&#x27;, removing the &#x27;moving-to-paused&#x27; value,
   if present, from its &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attribute, and adding
   the &#x27;paused&#x27; value to its &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attribute.

   This operation MUST NOT affect the acceptance of Job Creation
   requests (see Disable-Printer Operation, <a href="#section-3.1.1">section 3.1.1</a>).

   For any jobs that are &#x27;pending&#x27; or &#x27;pending-held&#x27;, the &#x27;printer-
   stopped&#x27; values of the jobs&#x27; &quot;job-state-reasons&quot; attribute also
   apply.  However, the IPP Printer NEED NOT update those jobs&#x27; &quot;job-
   state-reasons&quot; attributes and only have to return the &#x27;printer-
   stopped&#x27; value when those jobs are queried by using the Get-Job-
   Attributes or Get-Jobs operations (so-called &quot;lazy evaluation&quot;).

   The IPP Printer MUST accept the request in any state and transition
   the Printer to the indicated new &quot;printer-state&quot;, and it MUST add the
   indicated value to &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attribute before returning
   as follows:

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)
   performing this operation must be an operator or administrator of the
   Printer object (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-8.5">8.5</a>).

   The Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job Request and Pause-Printer-After-
   Current-Job Response have the same attribute groups and attributes as
   does the Pause-Printer operation (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-3.2.7.1">3.2.7.1</a> and
   3.2.7.2), including the new &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; operation
   attribute (see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Hold and Release New Jobs Operations</span>

   This section defines operations to condition the Printer to hold any
   new jobs and to release them.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.1" href="#section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  Hold-New-Jobs Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to condition the Printer to
   complete the current &#x27;pending&#x27; and &#x27;processing&#x27; IPP Jobs but not to
   start processing any subsequently created IPP Jobs.  If the IPP
   Printer is in the middle of sending an IPP job to an Output Device or
   Subordinate Printer, the IPP Printer MUST complete sending that Job.
   Furthermore, the IPP Printer MUST send all of the current &#x27;pending&#x27;
   IPP Jobs to the Output Device(s) or Subordinate IPP Printer
   object(s).  Any subsequently received Job Creation operations will
   cause the IPP Printer to put the Job into the &#x27;pending-held&#x27; state,
   with the &#x27;job-held-on-create&#x27; value being added to the job&#x27;s &quot;job-
   state-reasons&quot; attribute.  Thus all newly accepted jobs will be
   automatically held by the Printer.

   When the Printer completes all the &#x27;pending&#x27; and &#x27;processing&#x27; jobs,
   it enters the &#x27;idle&#x27; state as usual.  An operator monitoring Printer
   state changes will know when the Printer has completed all current
   jobs because the Printer enters the &#x27;idle&#x27; state.

   This operation MUST NOT affect the acceptance of Job Creation
   requests (see Disable-Printer Operation, <a href="#section-3.1.1">section 3.1.1</a>), except to
   put the Jobs into the &#x27;pending-held&#x27; state, instead of the &#x27;pending&#x27;
   or &#x27;processing&#x27; state.

   The IPP Printer MUST accept the request in any state, MUST NOT
   transition the Printer to any other &quot;printer-state&quot;, and MUST add the
   &#x27;hold-new-jobs&#x27; value to the Printer&#x27;s &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot;
   attribute (whether the value was present or not).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.2" href="#section-3.3.2">3.3.2</a>.  Release-Held-New-Jobs Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to undo the effect of a
   previous Hold-New-Jobs operation.  In particular, the Printer
   releases all the jobs that it held as a consequence of a Hold-New-
   Jobs operations; i.e., while the &#x27;hold-new-jobs&#x27; value was present in
   the Printer&#x27;s &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attribute.  In addition, the
   Printer MUST accept this request in any state, MUST NOT transition
   the Printer to any other &quot;printer-state&quot;, and MUST remove the &#x27;hold-
   new-jobs&#x27; value from its &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attribute (whether
   the value was present or not) so that the Printer no longer holds
   newly created jobs.

   accepting all requests except queries and performing work.  If either
   of these operations are supported, both MUST be supported.

   These operations allow the operator to put the Printer into a dormant

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4.1" href="#section-3.4.1">3.4.1</a>.  Deactivate-Printer Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to stop the Printer object
   from sending IPP jobs to any of its Output Devices or Subordinate
   Printers (Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job) and to stop the Printer
   object from accepting any requests but query requests.  The Printer
   performs a Disable-Printer and a Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job
   operation immediately.  If these two operations cannot be completed
   immediately, it includes use of all of the &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot;.
   In addition, the Printer MUST immediately reject all requests, except
   for Activate-Printer, queries (Get-Printer-Attributes, Get-Job-
   Attributes, Get-Jobs, etc.), Send-Document, and Send-URI (so that
   partial job submission can be completed, see <a href="#section-3.1.1">section 3.1.1</a>).  The
   Printer MUST then return the &#x27;server-error-service-unavailable&#x27;
   status code.

   The IPP Printer MUST accept the request in any state.  Immediately,
   the Printer MUST set the &#x27;deactivated&#x27; value in its &quot;printer-state-
   reasons&quot; attribute.  Note: neither the Disable-Printer nor the
   Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job set the &#x27;deactivated&#x27; value.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4.2" href="#section-3.4.2">3.4.2</a>.  Activate-Printer Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to undo the effects of the
   Deactivate-Printer; i.e., it allows the Printer object to start
   sending IPP jobs to any of its Output Devices or Subordinate Printers
   (Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job) and starts the Printer object from
   accepting any requests.  The Printer performs an Enable-Printer and a
   Resume-Printer operation immediately.  In addition, the Printer MUST
   immediately start accepting all requests.

   The IPP Printer MUST accept the request in any state.  The Printer
   MUST immediately remove the &#x27;deactivated&#x27; value from its &quot;printer-
   state-reasons&quot; attribute (whether it is present or not).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Restart-Printer, Shutdown-Printer, and Startup-Printer Operations</span>

   This section defines the OPTIONAL Restart-Printer, Shutdown-Printer,
   and Startup-Printer operations that initialize, shutdown, and start
   up the Printer object, respectively.  Each of these operations is
   OPTIONAL, and any combination MAY be supported.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.1" href="#section-3.5.1">3.5.1</a>.  Restart-Printer Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to restart a Printer object
   whose operation is in need of initialization because of incorrect or
   erratic behavior; i.e., perform the effect of a software re-boot.
   The implementation MUST attempt to save any information about Jobs
   and the Printer object before re-initializing.  However, this
   operation MAY have drastic consequences on the running system, so the
   client SHOULD first try the Deactivate-Printer operation to minimize
   the effect on the current state of the system.  The effects of
   previous Disable-Printer, Pause Printer, and Deactivate-Printer
   operations are lost.

   The IPP Printer MUST accept the request in any state.  The Printer
   object MUST initialize its Printer&#x27;s &quot;printer-state&quot; to &#x27;idle&#x27;,
   remove the state reasons from its &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attribute,
   and change its &quot;printer-is-accepting-jobs&quot; attribute to &#x27;true&#x27;.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)

   The Restart-Printer Request and Restart-Printer Response have the

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.2" href="#section-3.5.2">3.5.2</a>.  Shutdown-Printer Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to shutdown a Printer; i.e.,
   to stop processing jobs without losing any jobs and to make the
   Printer object unavailable for any operations using the IPP protocol.
   There is no way to bring the instance of the Printer object back to
   being used, except for the Startup-Printer (see <a href="#section-3.5.3">section 3.5.3</a>), which
   starts up a new instance of the Printer object for hosted

   implementations.  The purpose of Shutdown-Printer is to shutdown the
   Printer for an extended period, not to reset the device(s) or modify
   a Printer attribute.  See Restart-Printer (<a href="#section-3.5.1">section 3.5.1</a>) and
   Startup-Printer (<a href="#section-3.5.3">section 3.5.3</a>) for the way to initialize the
   software.  See the Disable-Printer operation (<a href="#section-3.1">section 3.1</a>) for a way
   for the client to stop the Printer from accepting Job Creation
   requests without stopping processing or shutting down.

   The Printer MUST add the &#x27;shutdown&#x27; value (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], <a href="#section-4.4.11">section</a>
   <a href="#section-4.4.11">4.4.11</a>) immediately to its &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; Printer
   Description attribute.  It then performs a Deactivate-Printer
   operation (see <a href="#section-3.4.1">section 3.4.1</a>), which in turn performs Disable-Printer
   and Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job operations).

   Note:  To shutdown the Printer after all the currently submitted jobs
   have completed, the operator issues a Disable-Printer operation (see
   <a href="#section-3.1.1">section 3.1.1</a>) and then waits until all the jobs have completed.  The
   Printer goes into the &#x27;idle&#x27; state before issuing the Shutdown-
   Printer operation.

   The Printer object MUST accept this operation in any state and
   transition the Printer object through the &quot;printer-states&quot; and
   &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; defined for the Pause-Printer-After-Current-
   Job operation until the activity is completed and the Printer object
   disappears.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.3" href="#section-3.5.3">3.5.3</a>.  Startup-Printer operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to start up an instance of a
   Printer object, provided that there isn&#x27;t one already initiated.  The
   purpose of Startup-Printer is to allow a hosted implementation of the
   IPP Printer object (i.e., a Server that implements an IPP Printer on
   behalf of a networked or local Output Device) to be started after the
   host is available (by means outside this document).  See <a href="#section-3.5.1">section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.5.1">3.5.1</a> for the way to initialize the software or reset the Output
   Device(s) when the IPP Printer object has already been initiated.

   The host MUST accept this operation only when the Printer object has
   not been initiated.  If the Printer object already exists, the host
   must return the &#x27;client-error-not-possible&#x27; status code.

   The result of this operation MUST be with the Printer object&#x27;s
   &quot;printer-state&quot; set to &#x27;idle&#x27;, the state reasons removed from its
   &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attribute, and its &quot;printer-is-accepting-
   jobs&quot; attribute set to &#x27;false&#x27;.  Then the operator can reconfigure
   the Printer before performing an Enable-Printer operation.  However,
   when a Printer is first powered up, it is RECOMMENDED that its
   &quot;printer-is-accepting-jobs&quot; attribute be set to &#x27;true&#x27; in order to
   achieve easy &quot;out of the box&quot; operation.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Definition of the Job Operations</span>

   All Job operations are directed at Job objects.  A client MUST always
   supply some means to identify the Job object in order to select the
   correct target of the operation.  That job identification MAY either
   be a single Job URI or a combination of a Printer URI and a Job ID.
   The IPP object implementation MUST support both forms of
   identification for every job.

   The Job Operations defined in this document are summarized in Table
   4.

   Suspend-            0x2E      Suspends the current processing job on

   Resume-Job          0x2F      Resumes the suspended target job.

   Promote-Job         0x30      Promotes the pending target job to be

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Reprocess-Job Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation is a create job operation that allows a
   client to re-process a copy of a job that had been retained in the
   queue after processing was completed, canceled, or aborted (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-4.3.7.2">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;4.3.7.2</a>).  This operation is the same as the
   Restart-Job operation (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.3.7">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.3.7</a>), except that the
   Printer creates a new job that is a copy of the target job and the
   target job is unchanged.  New values are assigned to the &quot;job-uri&quot;
   and &quot;job-id&quot; attributes.  The new job&#x27;s Job Description attributes
   that track job progress, such as &quot;job-impressions-completed&quot;, &quot;job-
   media-sheets-completed&quot;, and &quot;job-k-octets-processed&quot;, are
   initialized to 0, as with any create job operation.  The target job
   moves to the Job History after a suitable period, independent of
   whether one or more Reprocess-Job operations have been performed upon
   it.

   If the Set-Job-Attributes operation is supported, then the &quot;job-
   hold-until&quot; operation attribute MUST be supported with at least the
   &#x27;indefinite&#x27; value, so that a client can modify the new job before it
   is scheduled for processing by using the Set-Job-Attributes
   operation.  After modifying the job, the client can release the job
   for processing by using the Release-Job operation specifying the
   newly assigned &quot;job-uri&quot; or &quot;job-id&quot; for the new job.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Cancel-Current-Job Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to cancel the current job on
   the target Printer or the specified job if it is the current job on
   the Printer.  See <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.3.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.3.3</a>, for the semantics of
   canceling a job.  Since a Job might already be marking by the time a
   Cancel-Current-Job is received, some media sheet pages might print
   before the job is actually terminated.

   If the client does not supply a &quot;job-id&quot; operation attribute, the
   Printer MUST accept the request and cancel the current job if there
   is a current job in the &#x27;processing&#x27; or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state;
   otherwise, it MUST reject the request and return the &#x27;client-error-
   not-possible&#x27; status code.  If more than one job is in the
   &#x27;processing&#x27; or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state, the one that is marking
   is canceled, and the others are unaffected.

   Warning:  On a shared printer, there is a race condition.  Between
   the time when a user issues this operation and the time of its
   acceptance, the current job might change to a different job.  If the
   user or operator is authenticated to cancel the new job, the wrong
   job is canceled.  To prevent this race from canceling the wrong job,
   the client MAY supply the &quot;job-id&quot; operation attribute, which is
   checked against the current job&#x27;s job-id.  If the job identified by
   the &quot;job-id&quot; attribute is not the current job on the Printer (i.e.,
   is not in the &#x27;processing&#x27; or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state), the
   Printer MUST reject this operation and return the &#x27;client-error-not-
   possible&#x27; status code.  Otherwise, the Printer cancels the specified
   job.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)
   performing this operation must either be the job owner (as determined
   in the Job Creation operation) or an operator or administrator of the
   Printer object (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-8.5">8.5</a>).

   The Cancel-Current-Job Request and Cancel-Current-Job Response have
   the same attribute groups and attributes as does the Resume-Printer
   operation (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.2.8">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.2.8</a>), including the new &quot;job-
   message-from-operator&quot; operation attribute (see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>), with the
   addition of the following Group 1 Operation attribute in the request:

   &quot;job-id&quot; (integer(1:MAX)):
      The client OPTIONALLY supplies this Operation attribute to verify
      that the identified job is still the current job on the target
      Printer object.  The IPP object MUST support this operation
      attribute if it supports this operation.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Suspend and Resume Job Operations</span>

   This section defines the Suspend-Current-Job and Resume-Job
   operations.  These operations allow an operator or user to suspend a
   job while it is processing, allowing other jobs to be processed, and
   to resume the suspended job at a later point without losing any of
   the output.

   If either of these operations is supported, both MUST be supported.

   The Hold-Job and Release-Job operations (<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.3.5">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.3.5</a>)
   are for holding and releasing held jobs, not suspending and resuming
   suspended jobs.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3.1" href="#section-4.3.1">4.3.1</a>.  Suspend-Current-Job Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to stop the current job on
   the target Printer or the specified job if it is the current job on
   the Printer, to allow other jobs to be processed instead.  The
   Printer moves the current job or the target job to the &#x27;processing-
   stopped&#x27; state and sets the &#x27;job-suspended&#x27; value (see <a href="#section-9.1">section 9.1</a>)
   in the job&#x27;s &quot;job-state-reasons&quot; attribute and processes other jobs.

   If the client does not supply a &quot;job-id&quot; operation attribute, the
   Printer MUST accept the request and suspend the current job if there
   is a current job in the &#x27;processing&#x27; or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state.
   Otherwise, it MUST reject the request and return the &#x27;client-error-
   not-possible&#x27; status code.  If more than one job is in the
   &#x27;processing&#x27; or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state, all of them are
   suspended.

   Warning:  On a shared printer, there is a race condition.  Between
   the time when a user issues this operation and the time of its
   acceptance, the current job might change to a different job.  If the
   user or operator is authenticated to suspend the new job, the wrong
   job is suspended.  To prevent this race from pausing the wrong job,
   the client MAY supply the &quot;job-id&quot; operation attribute, which is
   checked against the current job&#x27;s job-id.  If the job identified by
   the &quot;job-id&quot; attribute is not the current job on the Printer (i.e.,
   is not in the &#x27;processing&#x27; or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state), the
   Printer MUST reject this operation and return the &#x27;client-error-not-
   possible&#x27; status code.  Otherwise, the Printer suspends the specified
   job and processed other jobs.

   The Printer MUST reject a Suspend-Current-Job request (and return the
   &#x27;client-error-not-possible&#x27;) for a job that has been suspended, i.e.,
   for a job in the &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state, with the &#x27;job-suspended&#x27;
   value in its &quot;job-state-reasons&quot; attribute.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)

   the same attribute groups and attributes as does the Pause-Printer
   operation (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.2.8">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.2.8</a> ), including the new &quot;job-

   addition of the following Group 1 Operation attribute in the request:

   &quot;job-id&quot; (integer(1:MAX)):
      The client OPTIONALLY supplies this Operation attribute to verify
      that the identified job is still the current job on the target
      Printer object.  The IPP object MUST support this operation
      attribute if it supports this operation.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3.2" href="#section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>.  Resume-Job Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to resume the target job at
   the point where it was suspended.  The Printer moves the target job
   to the &#x27;pending&#x27; state and removes the &#x27;job-suspended&#x27; value from the
   job&#x27;s &quot;job-state-reasons&quot; attribute.

   If the target job is not in the &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state, with the
   &#x27;job-suspended&#x27; value in the job&#x27;s &quot;job-state-reasons&quot; attribute, the
   Printer MUST reject the request and return the &#x27;client-error-not-
   possible&#x27; status code, since the job was not suspended.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)
   performing this operation must be either the job owner (as determined

   The Resume-Job Request and Resume-Job Response have the same
   attribute groups and attributes as the Release-Job operation (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.3.6">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.3.6</a>), including the new &quot;job-message-from-

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  Promote-Job Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to make the pending target
   job be processed next after the current job completes.  This
   operation is especially useful in a production printing environment
   where the operator is involved in job scheduling.

   If the target job is in the &#x27;pending&#x27; state, this operation does not
   change the job&#x27;s state but causes the job to be processed after the
   current job(s) complete.  If the target job is not in the &#x27;pending&#x27;
   state, the Printer MUST reject the request and return the &#x27;client-
   error-not-possible&#x27; status code.

   If the Printer implements the &quot;job-priority&quot; Job Template attribute
   (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-4.2.1">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;4.2.1</a>), the Printer sets the job&#x27;s &quot;job-
   priority&quot; to the highest value supported (so that the job will print
   before any of the other pending jobs).  The Printer returns the
   target job immediately after the current job(s) in a Get-Jobs
   response (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.2.6">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.2.6</a>) for the &#x27;not-completed&#x27; jobs.

   When the current job is completed, canceled, suspended (see <a href="#section-4.3.1">section</a>
   <a href="#section-4.3.1">4.3.1</a>), or aborted, the target of this operation is processed next.

   If a client issues this request (again) before the target of the
   operation of the original request started processing, the target of
   this new request is processed first.

   IPP is specified not to require queues for job scheduling, as there
   are other implementation techniques for scheduling multiple jobs,
   such as re-evaluating a criteria function for each job on a
   scheduling cycle.  However, if an implementation does implement
   queues for jobs, then the Promote-Job operation puts the specified
   job at the front of the queue.  A subsequent Promote-Job operation
   prior to the processing of the first job puts that specified job at
   the front of the queue, so that it is &quot;in front&quot; of the previously
   promoted job.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)
   performing this operation must be an operator or administrator of the
   Printer object (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-8.5">8.5</a>).

   The Promote-Job Request and Promote-Job Response have the same
   attribute groups and attributes as does the Cancel-Job operation (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.3.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.3.3</a>), including the new &quot;job-message-from-
   operator&quot; operation attribute (see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.  Schedule-Job-After Operation</span>

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to request that the Printer
   schedule the target job so that it will be processed immediately
   after the specified predecessor job, all other scheduling factors
   being equal.  This operation is specially useful in a production
   printing environment where the operator is involved in job
   scheduling.




<span class="grey">Kugler, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 21]</span></pre>

   If the target job is in the &#x27;pending&#x27; state, this operation does not
   change the job&#x27;s state but causes the job to be processed after the
   preceding job completes.  The preceding job can be in the target
   &#x27;pending&#x27;, &#x27;processing&#x27;, or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state.  If the
   target job is not in the &#x27;pending&#x27; state, or if the predecessor job
   is not in the &#x27;pending&#x27;, &#x27;processing&#x27;, or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state,
   the Printer MUST reject the request, and it returns the &#x27;client-
   error-not-possible&#x27; status code, as the job cannot have its position
   changed.

   If the Printer implements the &quot;job-priority&quot; Job Template attribute
   (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-4.2.1">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;4.2.1</a>), the Printer sets the job&#x27;s &quot;job-
   priority&quot; to that of the predecessor job (so that the job will print
   after the predecessor job).  The Printer returns the target job
   immediately after the predecessor in a Get-Jobs response (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.2.6">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.2.6</a>) for the &#x27;not-completed&#x27; jobs.

   When the predecessor job completes processing or is canceled or
   aborted while processing, the target of this operation is processed
   next.

   If the client does not supply a predecessor job, this operation has
   the same semantics as Promote-Job (see <a href="#section-4.4">section 4.4</a>).

   IPP is specified not to require queues for job scheduling, as there
   are other implementation techniques for scheduling multiple jobs,
   such as re-evaluating a criteria function for each job on a
   scheduling cycle.  However, if an implementation does implement
   queues for jobs, then the Schedule-Job-After operation puts the
   specified job immediately after the specified job in the queue.  A
   subsequent Schedule-Job-After operation specifying the same job will
   cause its target job to be placed after that job, even though it is
   between the first target job and the specified job.  For example,
   suppose the job queue consisted of jobs A, B, C, D, and E, in that
   order.  A Schedule-Job-After with job E as the target and B as the
   specified job would result in the following queue:  A, B, E, C, D.  A
   subsequent Schedule-Job-After with Job D as the target and B as the
   specified job would result in the following queue:  A, B, D, E, C.

   In other words, the link between the two jobs in a Schedule-Job-After
   operation is not retained; i.e., there is no attribute on either job
   that points to the other job as a result of this operation.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;8.3</a>)
   performing this operation must be an operator or administrator of the

   The Schedule-Job-After Request have the same attribute groups and
   attributes as does the Cancel-Job operation (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>], <a href="#section-3.3.3">section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.3.3">3.3.3</a>), plus the new &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; operation attribute
   (see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>).  In addition, the following operation attribute is
   defined:

   &quot;predecessor-job-id&quot;:
      The client OPTIONALLY supplies this attribute.  The Printer MUST
      support it, if it supports this operation.  This attribute
      specifies the job after which the target job is to be processed.
      If the client omits this attribute, the Printer MUST process the
      target job next, i.e., after the current job, if there is one.

   The Schedule-Job-After Response has the same attribute groups,
   attributes, and status codes as does the Cancel-Job operation (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-3.3.3">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;3.3.3</a>).  The following status codes have
   particular meaning for this operation:

   &#x27;client-error-not-possible&#x27; - The target job was not in the &#x27;pending&#x27;
   state, or the predecessor job was not in the &#x27;pending&#x27;, &#x27;processing&#x27;,
   or &#x27;processing-stopped&#x27; state.

   &#x27;client-error-not-found&#x27; - Either the target job or the predecessor
   job was not found.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  New Printer Description Attributes</span>

   The following new Printer Description attributes are needed to
   support the new operations defined in this document and the concepts
   of Printer Fan-Out (see <a href="#section-10">section 10</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  subordinate-printers-supported (1setOf uri)</span>

   This Printer attribute is REQUIRED if an implementation supports
   Subordinate Printers (see <a href="#section-10">section 10</a>) and contains the URIs of the
   immediate Subordinate Printer object(s) associated with this Printer
   object.  Each Non-Leaf Printer object MUST support this Printer
   Description attribute.  A Leaf Printer object either does not support
   the &quot;subordinate-printers-supported&quot; attribute or does so with the
   &#x27;no-value&#x27; out-of-band value (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-4.1">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;4.1</a>), depending
   on the implementation.

   The precise format of the Subordinate Printer URIs is implementation
   dependent (see <a href="#section-10.4">section 10.4</a>).

   If the Printer object does not have an associated Output Device, the
   Printer MAY automatically copy the value of the Subordinate Printer
   object&#x27;s &quot;printer-name&quot; attribute to the Job object&#x27;s &quot;output-
   device-assigned&quot; attribute (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-4.3.13">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;4.3.13</a>).  The
   &quot;output-device-assigned&quot; Job attribute identifies the Output Device
   to which the Printer object has assigned a job; for example, when a
   single Printer object is supporting Device Fan-Out or Printer Fan-
   Out.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  parent-printers-supported (1setOf uri)</span>

   This Printer attribute is REQUIRED if an implementation supports
   Subordinate Printers (see <a href="#section-10">section 10</a>) and contains the URI of the
   Non-Leaf printer object(s) for which this Printer object is the
   immediate Subordinate; i.e., this Printer&#x27;s immediate &quot;parent&quot; or
   &quot;parents&quot;.  Each Subordinate Printer object MUST support this Printer
   Description attribute.  A Printer that has no parents either does not
   support the &quot;parent-printers-supported&quot; attribute or does so with the
   &#x27;no-value&#x27; out-of-band value (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-4.1">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;4.1</a>), depending
   on the implementation.

   &#x27;hold-new-jobs&#x27;: The operator has issued the Hold-New-Jobs operation
      (see <a href="#section-3.3.1">section 3.3.1</a>) or other means, but the output-device(s) are
      taking an appreciable time to stop.  Later, when all output has
      stopped, the &quot;printer-state&quot; becomes &#x27;stopped&#x27;, and the &#x27;paused&#x27;
      value replaces the &#x27;moving-to-paused&#x27; value in the &quot;printer-
      state-reasons&quot; attribute.  This value MUST be supported if the
      Hold-New-Jobs operation is supported and the implementation takes
      significant time to pause a device in certain circumstances.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-8.2" href="#section-8.2">8.2</a>.  &#x27;deactivated&#x27; Value</span>

   &#x27;deactivated&#x27;:  A client has issued a Deactivate-Printer operation
      for the Printer object (see <a href="#section-3.4.1">section 3.4.1</a>), and the Printer is in
      the process of becoming deactivated or has become deactivated.
      The Printer MUST reject all requests except for Activate-Printer,
      queries (Get-Printer-Attributes, Get-Job-Attributes, Get-Jobs,
      etc.), Send-Document, and Send-URI (so that partial job submission
      can be completed; see <a href="#section-3.1.1">section 3.1.1</a>), and then return the

   &#x27;job-suspended&#x27;:  While job processing has been suspended by the
      Suspend-Current-Job operation, other jobs can be processed on the
      Printer.  The Job can be resumed with the Resume-Job operation,
      which removes this value.

   This section defines how the Printer object MAY be used to represent
   IPP Printer Fan-Out and IPP Printer Fan-In.  In Fan-Out, an IPP
   Printer is used to represent other IPP Printer objects.  In Fan-In,
   several IPP Printer objects are used to represent another IPP Printer
   object.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.1" href="#section-10.1">10.1</a>.  IPP Printer Fan-Out</span>

   The IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics introduces the semantic concept of an
   IPP Printer object that represents more than one Output Device (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-2.1">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;2.1</a>).  This concept is called &quot;Output Device Fan-
   Out&quot;.  However, with Fan-Out there was no way to represent the
   individual states of the Output Devices or to perform operations on a
   specific Output Device.  This document generalizes the semantics of
   the Printer object to represent Subordinate Fan-Out Output Devices
   such as IPP Printer objects.  This concept is called &quot;Printer object
   Fan-Out&quot;.  A Printer object that has a Subordinate Printer object is
   called a Non-Leaf Printer object.  Thus, a Non-Leaf Printer object
   supports one or more Subordinate Printer objects in order to
   represent Printer object Fan-Out.  A Printer object that does not
   have any Subordinate Printer objects is called a Leaf Printer object.

   Each Non-Leaf Printer object submits jobs to its immediate
   Subordinate Printers and otherwise controls the Subordinate Printers
   by using IPP or other protocols.  Whether pending jobs are kept in
   the Non-Leaf Printer until a Subordinate Printer can accept them or
   are kept in the Subordinate Printers depends on implementation and/or
   configuration policy.  Furthermore, a Subordinate Printer object MAY,
   in turn, have Subordinate Printer objects.  Thus a Printer object can
   be both a Non-Leaf Printer and a Subordinate Printer.

   A Subordinate Printer object MUST be a conforming Printer object, so
   it MUST support all of the REQUIRED [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>] operations and
   attributes.  However, with access control, the Subordinate Printer
   MAY be configured so that end-user clients are not permitted to
   perform any operations (or just Get-Printer-Attributes) while one or
   more Non-Leaf Printer object(s) are permitted to perform any
   operation.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.2" href="#section-10.2">10.2</a>.  IPP Printer Fan-In</span>

   The IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics did not preclude the semantic concept
   of multiple IPP Printer objects that represent a single Output Device
   (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-2.1">[RFC2911], section&nbsp;2.1</a>).  However, there was no way for the
   client to determine whether there was a Fan-In configuration; nor was
   there a way to perform operations on the Subordinate device.  This
   specification generalizes the semantics of the Printer object to
   allow several Non-Leaf IPP Printer objects to represent a single
   Subordinate Printer object.  Thus a Non-Leaf Printer object MAY share
   a Subordinate Printer object with one or more other Non-Leaf Printer
   objects in order to represent IPP Printer Fan-In.

   As with Fan-Out (see <a href="#section-10.1">section 10.1</a>), when a Printer object is a Non-
   Leaf Printer, it MUST NOT have an associated Output Device.  As with

   Fan-Out, a Leaf Printer object has one or more associated Output
   Devices.  As with Fan-Out, the Non-Leaf Printer objects submit jobs
   to their Subordinate Printer objects and otherwise control the
   Subordinate Printer.  As with Fan-Out, whether pending jobs are kept
   in the Non-Leaf Printers until the Subordinate Printer can accept
   them or are kept in the Subordinate Printer depends on the
   implementation and/or configuration policy.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.3" href="#section-10.3">10.3</a>.  Printer Object Attributes Used to Represent Printer Fan-Out and</span>
<span class="h3">       Printer Fan-In</span>

   The following Printer Description attributes are defined to represent
   the relationship between Printer object(s) and their Subordinate
   Printer object(s):

      1. &quot;subordinate-printers-supported&quot; (1setOf uri) - Contains the
         URI of the immediate Subordinate Printer object(s).

      2. &quot;parent-printers-supported (1setOf uri) - Contains the URI of
         the Non-Leaf printer object(s) for which this Printer object is
         the immediate Subordinate; i.e., this Printer&#x27;s immediate
         &quot;parent&quot; or &quot;parents&quot;.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.4" href="#section-10.4">10.4</a>.  Subordinate Printer URI</span>

   Each Subordinate Printer object has a URI used as the target of each
   operation on the Subordinate Printer.  The means to configure URIs
   for Subordinate Printer objects is implementation-dependent, as are
   all URIs.  However, there are two distinct approaches:

      a. When the implementation seeks to make sure that no operation on
         a Subordinate Printer object &quot;sneaks by&quot; the parent Printer
         object (or that no Subordinate Printer is fronting for a device
         that is not networked), the host part of the URI specifies the
         host of the parent Printer.  Then the parent Printer object can
         easily reflect the state of the Subordinate Printer objects in
         the parent&#x27;s Printer object state and state reasons as the
         operation passes &quot;through&quot; the parent Printer object.

      b. When the Subordinate Printer is networked and the
         implementation allows operations to go directly to the
         Subordinate Printer (with proper access control) without
         knowledge of the parent Printer object, the host part of the
         URI is different from the host part of the parent Printer
         object.  In this a case, the parent Printer object MAY keep its
         &quot;printer-state&quot; and &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; up to date, either
         by polling the Subordinate Printer object or by subscribing to
         events with the Subordinate Printer object (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3995" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions&quot;">RFC3995</a>] for



<span class="grey">Kugler, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 29]</span></pre>

         means to subscribe to event notification when the Subordinate
         Printer object supports IPP notification).  Alternatively, the
         parent Printer MAY wait until its &quot;printer-state&quot; and
         &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; attributes are queried and then query
         all its Subordinate Printers in order to return the correct
         values.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.5" href="#section-10.5">10.5</a>.  Printer Object Attributes Used to Represent Output Device Fan-Out</span>

   Only Leaf IPP Printer objects are allowed to have one or more
   associated Output Devices.  Each Leaf Printer object MAY support the
   &quot;output-devices-supported&quot; (1setOf name(127)) to indicate the user-
   friendly name(s) of the Output Device(s) that the Leaf Printer object
   represents.  It is RECOMMENDED that each Leaf Printer object have
   only one associated Output Device, so that the individual Output
   Devices can be represented completely and controlled completely by
   clients.  In other words, the Leaf Printer&#x27;s &quot;output-devices-
   supported&quot; attribute SHOULD have only one value.

   Non-Leaf Printer MUST NOT have associated Output Devices.  However, a
   Non-Leaf Printer SHOULD support an &quot;output-devices-supported&quot; (1setOf
   name(127)) Printer Description attribute that contains all the values
   of its immediate Subordinate Printers.  As these Subordinate Printers
   MAY be Leaf or Non-Leaf, the same rules apply to them.  Thus any
   Non-Leaf Printer SHOULD have an &quot;output-devices-supported&quot; (1setOf
   name(127)) attribute that contains all the values of the Output
   Devices associated with Leaf Printers of its complete sub-tree.

   When a configuration of Printers and Output Devices is added, moved,
   or changed, there can be moments when the tree structure is not
   consistent; i.e., times when a Non-Leaf Printer&#x27;s &quot;subordinate-
   printers-supported&quot; does not agree with the Subordinate Printer&#x27;s
   &quot;parent-printers-supported&quot;.  Therefore, the operator SHOULD first
   Deactivate all Printers being configured in this way, update all
   pointer attributes, and then reactivate them.  A useful client tool
   would validate a tree structure before Activating the Printers
   involved.

   In Printer Fan-Out, Printer Fan-In, and Chained Printers, the Non-
   Leaf IPP Printer object MUST NOT forward the operations that affect
   Printer objects to its Subordinate Printer objects.  If a client
   seeks to explicitly target a Subordinate Printer, the client MUST
   specify the URI of the Subordinate Printer.  The client can determine
   the URI of any Subordinate Printers by querying the Printer&#x27;s
   &quot;subordinate-printers-supported (1setOf uri) attribute (see <a href="#section-7.1">section</a>
   <a href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>).

   Table 7 lists the operations that affect Printer objects and the
   forwarding behavior that a Non-Leaf Printer MUST exhibit to its
   immediate Subordinate Printers.  Operations that affect jobs have a
   different forwarding rule (see <a href="#section-10.7.2">section 10.7.2</a> and Table 8):

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-10.7.2" href="#section-10.7.2">10.7.2</a>.  Forwarding Requests that Affect Jobs</span>

   Unlike Printer Operations that only affect Printer objects (see
   <a href="#section-10.7.1">section 10.7.1</a>), a Non-Leaf Printer object MUST forward operations
   that directly affect jobs to the appropriate Job object(s) in one or
   more of its immediate Subordinate Printer objects.  Forwarding is
   REQUIRED since the purpose of this Job operation is to affect the
   indicated job, which may have been forwarded itself.  This forwarding
   MAY be immediate or queued, depending on the operation and the
   implementation.  For example, a Non-Leaf Printer object MAY
   queue/spool jobs, feeding a job at a time to its Subordinate
   Printer(s), or MAY forward jobs immediately to one of its Subordinate
   Printers.  In either case, the Non-Leaf Printer object forwards Job
   Creation operations to one of its Subordinate Printers.  Only the
   time of forwarding of the Job Creation operations depends on whether
   the policy is to queue/spool jobs in the Non-Leaf Printer or the
   Subordinate Printer.

   When a Non-Leaf Printer object creates a Job object in its
   Subordinate Printer, whether that Non-Leaf Printer object keeps a
   fully formed Job object or just keeps a mapping from the &quot;job-ids&quot;
   that it assigned to those assigned by its Subordinate Printer object
   is IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT.  In either case, the Non-Leaf Printer
   MUST be able to accept and carry out future Job operations that
   specify the &quot;job-id&quot; that the Non-Leaf Printer assigned and returned
   to the job submitting client.

   Table 8 lists the operations that directly affect jobs and the
   forwarding behavior that a Non-Leaf Printer MUST exhibit to its
   Subordinate Printers.

   When a Printer receives a request that REQUIRES forwarding, it does
   so on a &quot;best efforts basis&quot; and returns a response to its client
   without waiting for responses from any of its Subordinate Printers.
   Such forwarded requests could fail.

   [<a id="ref-RFC2911">RFC2911</a>] defines &quot;output-device-assigned&quot; as follows:  &quot;This
   attribute identifies the Output Device to which the Printer object
   has assigned this job.  If an Output Device implements an embedded
   Printer object, the Printer object NEED NOT set this attribute.  If a
   print server implements a Printer object, the value MAY be empty
   (zero-length string) or not returned until the Printer object assigns
   an Output Device to the job.  This attribute is particularly useful
   when a single Printer object supports multiple devices (so called
   &quot;Device Fan-Out&quot; see <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911#section-2.1">[RFC2911] section&nbsp;2.1</a>).&quot;  See also <a href="#section-10.1">section 10.1</a>

   This document has the same localization considerations as [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-16" href="#section-16">16</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The IPP Model and Semantics document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>] discusses high level
   security requirements (Client Authentication, Server Authentication,
   and Operation Privacy).  Client Authentication is the mechanism by
   which the client proves its identity to the server in a secure
   manner.  Server Authentication is the mechanism by which the server
   proves its identity to the client in a secure manner.  Operation
   Privacy is defined as a mechanism for protecting operations from
   eavesdropping.

   Printer operations defined in this specification (see <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>), as
   well as Pause-Printer, Resume-Printer, and Purge-Job (defined in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>]) are intended for use by an operator and/or administrator.
   Job operations defined in this specification (see <a href="#section-4">section 4</a>) and
   Cancel-Job, Hold-Job, and Release-Job (defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>]) are
   intended for use by the job owner, operator, or administrator of the
   Printer object.  These operator and administrator operations affect
   service for all users.

   Inappropriate use of an administrative operation by an
   unauthenticated end user can affect the quality of service for all
   users.  Therefore, IPP Printer implementations MUST support both
   successful certificate-based TLS [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2246" title="&quot;The TLS Protocol Version 1.0&quot;">RFC2246</a>] client authentication and
   successful operator/administrator authorization (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>],
   sections <a href="#section-5.2.7">5.2.7</a> and <a href="#section-8">8</a>, and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2910" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport&quot;">RFC2910</a>]) to perform the administrative
   operations defined in this document.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2910" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport&quot;">RFC2910</a>] requires the IPP
   Printer to support the minimum cipher suite specified for TLS/1.0.
   The means for authorizing an operator or administrator of the Printer
   object are outside the scope of this specification, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2910">RFC 2910</a>, and <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911">RFC</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2911">2911</a>.

   The use of TLS and Client Authentication solves the Denial of
   Service, Man in the Middle, and Masquerading security threats.

      Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2567" title="&quot;Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol&quot;">RFC2567</a>]
      Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the
      Internet Printing Protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2568" title="&quot;Rationale for the Structure of the Model and Protocol for the Internet Printing Protocol&quot;">RFC2568</a>]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2911" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot;">RFC2911</a>]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2910" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport&quot;">RFC2910</a>]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer&#x27;s Guide [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3196" title="&quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementor&#x27;s Guide&quot;">RFC3196</a>]
      Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2569" title="&quot;Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols&quot;">RFC2569</a>]

   &quot;Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol&quot; takes a broad look
   at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates real-life
   scenarios that help clarify the features that have to be included in
   a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies requirements for
   three types of users: end users, operators, and administrators.  It
   calls out a subset of end user requirements that are satisfied in
   IPP/1.0.  A few OPTIONAL operator operations have been added to
   IPP/1.1.

   &quot;Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the Internet
   Printing Protocol&quot; describes IPP from a high level view, defines a
   roadmap for the various documents that form the suite of IPP
   specification documents, and gives background and rationale for the
   IETF working group&#x27;s major decisions.

   &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot; describes a
   simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes, and their
   operations that are independent of encoding and transport.  It
   introduces a Printer and a Job object.  The Job object optionally
   supports multiple documents per Job.  It also addresses security,
   internationalization, and directory issues.

   &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport&quot; is a formal
   mapping of the abstract operations and attributes defined in the
   model document onto HTTP/1.1 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2616" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1&quot;">RFC2616</a>].  It defines the encoding
   rules for a new Internet MIME media type called &quot;application/ipp&quot;.
   This document also defines the rules for transporting over HTTP a
   message body whose Content-Type is &quot;application/ipp&quot;.  This document
   defines the &#x27;ippget&#x27; scheme for identifying IPP printers and jobs.

   &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer&#x27;s Guide&quot; gives insight
   and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP objects.  It is
   intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of the
   considerations that may assist them in the design of their client
   and/or IPP object implementations.  For example, a typical order of
   processing requests is given, including error checking.  Motivation
   for some of the specification decisions is also included.

   &quot;Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols&quot; gives some advice to
   implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer Daemon)
   implementations.
