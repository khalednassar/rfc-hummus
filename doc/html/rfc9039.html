<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8141" title="&quot;Uniform Resource Names (URNs)&quot;">RFC8141</a>]
   namespace for hardware device identifiers.  A general representation
   of device identity can be useful in many applications, such as in
   sensor data streams and storage or in equipment inventories [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>]
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428" title="&quot;Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)&quot;">RFC8428</a>] [<a href="#ref-CoRE-RD" title="&quot;CoRE Resource Directory&quot;">CoRE-RD</a>].

   A URN-based representation can be passed along in applications that
   need the information.  It fits particularly well for protocols
   mechanisms that are designed to carry URNs [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7230" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing&quot;">RFC7230</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7540" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)&quot;">RFC7540</a>]
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3261" title="&quot;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol&quot;">RFC3261</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>].  Finally, URNs can also be easily carried and
   stored in formats such as XML [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-xml-19980210">W3C.REC-xml-19980210</a>], JSON [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>],
   or SenML [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428" title="&quot;Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)&quot;">RFC8428</a>].  Using URNs in these formats is often preferable
   as they are universally recognized and self-describing and therefore
   avoid the need to agree to interpret an octet string as a specific
   form of a Media Access Control (MAC) address, for instance.  Passing
   URNs may consume additional bytes compared to, for instance, passing
   4-byte binary IPv4 addresses, but the former offers some flexibility
   in return.

   This document defines identifier URN types for situations where no
   such convenient type already exists.  For instance, [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6920" title="&quot;Naming Things with Hashes&quot;">RFC6920</a>] defines
   cryptographic identifiers, [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7254" title="&quot;A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) and the International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI)&quot;">RFC7254</a>] defines International Mobile
   station Equipment Identity (IMEI) identifiers for use with 3GPP
   cellular systems, and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8464" title="&quot;A URN Namespace for Device Identity and Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID)&quot;">RFC8464</a>] defines Mobile Equipment Identity
   (MEID) identifiers for use with 3GPP2 cellular systems.  Those URN
   types should be employed when such identifiers are transported; this
   document does not redefine these identifiers in any way.

   Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URNs [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&quot;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&quot;">RFC4122</a>] are another
   alternative way to represent device identifiers and already support
   MAC addresses as one type of identifier.  However, UUIDs can be
   inconvenient in environments where it is important that the
   identifiers be as simple as possible and where additional
   requirements on stable storage, real-time clocks, and identifier
   length can be prohibitive.  Often, UUID-based identifiers are
   preferred for general purpose uses instead of the MAC-based device
   URNs defined in this document.  The device URNs are recommended for
   constrained environments.

   Future device identifier types can extend the device URN type defined
   in this document (see <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>), or they can define their own URNs.

   Note that long-term stable unique identifiers are problematic for
   privacy reasons and should be used with care as described in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7721" title="&quot;Security and Privacy Considerations for IPv6 Address Generation Mechanisms&quot;">RFC7721</a>].

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> defines
   the &quot;DEV&quot; URN type, and <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> defines subtypes for IEEE MAC-48,
   EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses, and 1-Wire device identifiers.
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> gives examples.  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> discusses the security and
   privacy considerations of the new URN type.  Finally, <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>
   specifies the IANA registration for the new URN type and sets
   requirements for subtype allocations within this type.

   Date:  2020-06-24

   Registrant:  IETF and the CORE Working Group.  Should the working
      group cease to exist, discussion should be directed to the
      Applications and Real-Time Area or general IETF discussion forums,
      or the IESG.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Purpose</span>

   The DEV URNs identify devices with device-specific identifiers such
   as network card hardware addresses.  DEV URNs are scoped to be
   globally applicable (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc8141#section-6.4.1">[RFC8141], Section&nbsp;6.4.1</a>) and, in general,
   enable systems to use these identifiers from multiple sources in an
   interoperable manner.  Note that in some deployments, ensuring
   uniqueness requires care if manual or local assignment mechanisms are
   used, as discussed in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.

   Some typical DEV URN applications include equipment inventories and
   smart object systems.

   DEV URNs can be used in various ways in applications, software
   systems, and network components, in tasks ranging from discovery (for
   instance, when discovering 1-Wire network devices or detecting MAC-
   addressable devices on a LAN) to intrusion detection systems and
   simple catalogues of system information.

   While it is possible to implement resolution systems for specific
   applications or network locations, DEV URNs are typically not used in
   a way that requires resolution beyond direct observation of the
   relevant identifier fields in local link communication.  However, it
   is often useful to be able to pass device identifier information in
   generic URN fields in databases or protocol fields, which makes the
   use of URNs for this purpose convenient.

   The DEV URN namespace complements existing namespaces such as those
   involving IMEI or UUID identifiers.  DEV URNs are expected to be a
   part of the IETF-provided basic URN types, covering identifiers that
   have previously not been possible to use in URNs.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Syntax</span>

   The identifier is expressed in ASCII characters and has a
   hierarchical structure as follows:

   devurn = &quot;urn:dev:&quot; body componentpart
   body = macbody / owbody / orgbody / osbody / opsbody / otherbody
   macbody = %s&quot;mac:&quot; hexstring
   owbody = %s&quot;ow:&quot; hexstring
   orgbody = %s&quot;org:&quot; posnumber &quot;-&quot; identifier *( &quot;:&quot; identifier )
   osbody = %s&quot;os:&quot; posnumber &quot;-&quot; serial *( &quot;:&quot; identifier )
   opsbody = %s&quot;ops:&quot; posnumber &quot;-&quot; product &quot;-&quot; serial
             *( &quot;:&quot; identifier )
   otherbody = subtype &quot;:&quot; identifier *( &quot;:&quot; identifier )
   subtype = LALPHA *(DIGIT / LALPHA)
   identifier = 1*devunreserved
   identifiernodash = 1*devunreservednodash
   product = identifiernodash
   serial = identifier
   componentpart = *( &quot;_&quot; identifier )
   devunreservednodash = ALPHA / DIGIT / &quot;.&quot;
   devunreserved = devunreservednodash / &quot;-&quot;
   hexstring = 1*(hexdigit hexdigit)
   hexdigit = DIGIT / &quot;a&quot; / &quot;b&quot; / &quot;c&quot; / &quot;d&quot; / &quot;e&quot; / &quot;f&quot;
   posnumber = NZDIGIT *DIGIT
   ALPHA =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A
   LALPHA =  %x41-5A
   NZDIGIT = %x31-39
   DIGIT =  %x30-39

   The above syntax is represented in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5234" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7405" title="&quot;Case-Sensitive String Support in ABNF&quot;">RFC7405</a>].  The syntax also copies the
   DIGIT and ALPHA rules originally defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5234" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>], exactly as
   defined there.

   The device identifier namespace includes five subtypes (see
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>), and more may be defined in the future as specified in
   <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   The optional underscore-separated components at the end of the DEV
   URN depict individual aspects of a device.  The specific strings and
   their semantics are up to the designers of the device but could be
   used to refer to specific interfaces or functions within the device.

   With the exception of the MAC address and 1-Wire DEV URNs, each DEV
   URN may also contain optional colon-separated identifiers.  These are
   provided for extensibility.

   There are no special character encoding rules or considerations for
   conforming with the URN syntax beyond those applicable for URNs in
   general [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8141" title="&quot;Uniform Resource Names (URNs)&quot;">RFC8141</a>] or the context where these URNs are carried (e.g.,
   inside JSON [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>] or SenML [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428" title="&quot;Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)&quot;">RFC8428</a>]).  Due to the SenML rules in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8428#section-4.5.1">[RFC8428], Section&nbsp;4.5.1</a>, it is not desirable to use percent-encoding
   in DEV URNs, and the subtypes defined in this specification do not
   really benefit from percent-encoding.  However, this specification
   does not deviate from the general syntax of URNs or their processing
   and normalization rules as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3986" title="&quot;Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax&quot;">RFC3986</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8141" title="&quot;Uniform Resource Names (URNs)&quot;">RFC8141</a>].

   DEV URNs do not use r-, q-, or f-components as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8141" title="&quot;Uniform Resource Names (URNs)&quot;">RFC8141</a>].

   Specific subtypes of DEV URNs may be validated through mechanisms
   discussed in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   The string representation of the device identifier URN is fully
   compatible with the URN syntax.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.1" href="#section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Character Case and URN-Equivalence</span>

   The DEV URN syntax allows both uppercase and lowercase characters.
   The URN-equivalence of the DEV URNs is defined per <a href="/doc/html/rfc8141#section-3.1">[RFC8141],
   Section&nbsp;3.1</a>, i.e., two URNs are URN-equivalent if their assigned-name
   portions are octet-by-octet equal after applying case normalization
   to the URI scheme (&quot;urn&quot;) and namespace identifier (&quot;dev&quot;).  The rest
   of the DEV URN is compared in a case-sensitive manner.  It should be
   noted that URN-equivalence matching merely quickly shows that two
   URNs are definitely the same for the purposes of caching and other
   similar uses.  Two DEV URNs may still refer to the same entity and
   may not be found to be URN-equivalent according to the [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8141" title="&quot;Uniform Resource Names (URNs)&quot;">RFC8141</a>]
   definition.  For instance, in ABNF, strings are case insensitive (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc5234#section-2.3">[RFC5234], Section&nbsp;2.3</a>), and a MAC address could be represented
   either with uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal digits.

   Character case is not otherwise significant for the DEV URN subtypes
   defined in this document.  However, future subtypes might include
   identifiers that use encodings such as base64, which encodes strings
   in a larger variety of characters and might even encode binary data.

   To facilitate equivalence checks, it is RECOMMENDED that
   implementations always use lowercase letters where they have a choice
   in case, unless there is a reason otherwise.  (Such a reason might
   be, for instance, the use of a subtype that requires the use of both
   uppercase and lowercase letters.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Assignment</span>

   The process for identifier assignment is dependent on the used
   subtype and is documented in the specific subsection under <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   Device identifiers are generally expected to identify a unique
   device, barring the accidental issue of multiple devices with the
   same identifiers.  In many cases, device identifiers can also be
   changed by users or are sometimes assigned in an algorithmic or local
   fashion.  Any potential conflicts arising from such assignments are
   not something that the DEV URNs as such manage; they simply are there
   to refer to a particular identifier.  And, of course, a single device
   may (and often does) have multiple identifiers, e.g., identifiers
   associated with different link technologies it supports.

   The DEV URN type SHOULD only be used for hardware-based identifiers
   that are expected to be persistent (with some limits, as discussed
   above).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Security and Privacy</span>

   As discussed in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>, care must be taken in the use of device-
   identifier-based identifiers due to their nature as long-term
   identifiers that are not normally changeable.  Leakage of these
   identifiers outside systems where their use is justified should be
   controlled.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Interoperability</span>

   There are no specific interoperability concerns.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.6" href="#section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Resolution</span>

   The device identifiers are not expected to be globally resolvable.
   No identifier resolution system is expected.  Systems may perform
   local matching of identifiers to previously seen identifiers or
   configured information, however.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  DEV URN Subtypes</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  MAC Addresses</span>

   DEV URNs of the &quot;mac&quot; subtype are based on the EUI-64 identifier
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE.EUI64">IEEE.EUI64</a>] derived from a device with a built-in 64-bit EUI-64.
   The EUI-64 is formed from 24 or 36 bits of organization identifier
   followed by 40 or 28 bits of device-specific extension identifier
   assigned by that organization.

   In the DEV URN &quot;mac&quot; subtype, the hexstring is simply the full EUI-64
   identifier represented as a hexadecimal string.  It is always exactly
   16 characters long.

   MAC-48 and EUI-48 identifiers are also supported by the same DEV URN
   subtype.  To convert a MAC-48 address to an EUI-64 identifier, the
   Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) of the MAC-48 address (the
   first three octets) becomes the organization identifier of the EUI-64
   (the first three octets).  The fourth and fifth octets of the EUI are
   set to the fixed value 0xffff (hexadecimal).  The last three octets
   of the MAC-48 address become the last three octets of the EUI-64.
   The same process is used to convert an EUI-48 identifier, but the
   fixed value 0xfffe is used instead.

   Identifier assignment for all of these identifiers rests within the
   IEEE Registration Authority.

   Note that where randomized MAC addresses are used, the resulting DEV
   URNs cannot be expected to have uniqueness, as discussed in
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  1-Wire Device Identifiers</span>

   The 1-Wire system is a device communications bus system designed by
   Dallas Semiconductor Corporation. (1-Wire is a registered trademark.)
   1-Wire devices are identified by a 64-bit identifier that consists of
   an 8-bit family code, a 48-bit identifier unique within a family, and
   an 8-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code [<a href="#ref-OW" title="&quot;Guide to 1-Wire Communication&quot;">OW</a>].

   In DEV URNs with the &quot;ow&quot; subtype, the hexstring is a representation
   of the full 64-bit identifier as a hexadecimal string.  It is always
   exactly 16 characters long.  Note that the last two characters
   represent the 8-bit CRC code.  Implementations MAY check the validity
   of this code.

   Family code and identifier assignment for all 1-Wire devices rests
   with the manufacturers.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Organization-Defined Identifiers</span>

   Device identifiers that have only a meaning within an organization
   can also be used to represent vendor-specific or experimental
   identifiers or identifiers designed for use within the context of an
   organization.

   Organizations are identified by their Private Enterprise Number (PEN)
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2578" title="&quot;Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)&quot;">RFC2578</a>].  These numbers can be obtained from IANA.  Current PEN
   assignments can be viewed at &lt;<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/">https://www.iana.org/assignments/</a>
   <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/">enterprise-numbers/</a>&gt;, and new assignments are requested at
   &lt;<a href="https://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page">https://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page</a>&gt;.

   Note that when included in an &quot;org&quot; DEV URN, the number cannot be
   zero or have leading zeroes, as the ABNF requires the number to start
   with a non-zero digit.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Organization Serial Numbers</span>

   The &quot;os&quot; subtype specifies an organization and serial number.
   Organizations are identified by their PEN.  As with the organization-
   defined identifiers (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>), PEN number assignments are
   maintained by IANA, and assignments for new organizations can be made
   easily.

      |  Historical note: The &quot;os&quot; subtype was originally defined in the
      |  Open Mobile Alliance &quot;Lightweight Machine to Machine&quot; standard
      |  [<a href="#ref-LwM2M" title="&quot;OMA Lightweight Machine to Machine Requirements&quot;">LwM2M</a>] but has been incorporated here to collect all syntaxes
      |  associated with DEV URNs in one place.  At the same time, the
      |  syntax of this subtype was changed to avoid the possibility of
      |  characters that are not allowed in the SenML Name field (see
      |  <a href="/doc/html/rfc8428#section-4.5.1">[RFC8428], Section&nbsp;4.5.1</a>).

   Organization serial number DEV URNs consist of the PEN number and the
   serial number.  As with other DEV URNs, for carrying additional
   information and extensibility, optional colon-separated identifiers
   and underscore-separated components may also be included.  The serial
   numbers themselves are defined by the organization, and this
   specification does not specify how they are allocated.

   Organizations are also encouraged to select serial number formats
   that avoid the possibility of ambiguity in the form of leading zeroes
   or otherwise.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Organization Product and Serial Numbers</span>

   The DEV URN &quot;ops&quot; subtype was originally defined in the LwM2M
   standard but has been incorporated here to collect all syntaxes
   associated with DEV URNs in one place.  The &quot;ops&quot; subtype specifies
   an organization, product class, and a serial number.  Organizations
   are identified by their PEN.  Again, as with the organization-defined
   identifiers (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>), PEN number assignments are maintained by
   IANA.

      |  Historical note: As with the &quot;os&quot; subtype, the &quot;ops&quot; subtype
      |  was originally defined in the Open Mobile Alliance &quot;Lightweight
      |  Machine to Machine&quot; standard [<a href="#ref-LwM2M" title="&quot;OMA Lightweight Machine to Machine Requirements&quot;">LwM2M</a>].

   Organization product and serial number DEV URNs consist of the PEN
   number, product class, and the serial number.  As with other DEV
   URNs, for carrying additional information and extensibility, optional
   colon-separated identifiers and underscore-separated components may
   also be included.  Both the product class and serial numbers
   themselves are defined by the organization, and this specification
   does not specify how they are allocated.

   Organizations are also encouraged to select product and serial number
   formats that avoid possibility for ambiguity.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.6" href="#section-4.6">4.6</a>.  Future Subtypes</span>

   Additional subtypes may be defined in future specifications.  See
   <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

   The DEV URN &quot;example&quot; subtype is reserved for use in examples.  It
   has no specific requirements beyond those expressed by the ABNF in
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

                                  Table 1

   The DEV URNs themselves can then appear in various contexts.  A
   simple example of this is the use of DEV URNs in SenML data.  This
   example from [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428" title="&quot;Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)&quot;">RFC8428</a>] shows a measurement from a 1-Wire temperature
   gauge encoded in the JSON syntax:

      [
        {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063&quot;,&quot;u&quot;:&quot;Cel&quot;,&quot;v&quot;:23.1}
      ]

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   On most devices, the user can display device identifiers.  Depending
   on circumstances, device identifiers may or may not be modified or
   tampered with by the user.  An implementation of the DEV URN MUST
   preserve such limitations and behaviors associated with the device
   identifiers.  In particular, a device identifier that is intended to
   be immutable should not become mutable as a part of implementing the
   DEV URN type.  More generally, nothing in this document should be
   construed to override what the relevant device specifications have
   already said about the identifiers.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Privacy</span>

   Other devices in the same network may or may not be able to identify
   the device.  For instance, on an Ethernet network, the MAC address of
   a device is visible to all other devices.

   DEV URNs often represent long-term stable unique identifiers for
   devices.  Such identifiers may have privacy and security implications
   because they may enable correlating information about a specific
   device over a long period of time, location tracking, and device-
   specific vulnerability exploitation [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7721" title="&quot;Security and Privacy Considerations for IPv6 Address Generation Mechanisms&quot;">RFC7721</a>].  Also, in some
   systems, there is no easy way to change the identifier.  Therefore,
   these identifiers need to be used with care, and special care should
   be taken to avoid leaking identifiers outside of the system that is
   intended to use them.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Validity</span>

   Information about identifiers may have significant effects in some
   applications.  For instance, in many sensor systems, the identifier
   information is used for deciding how to use the data carried in a
   measurement report.  In some other systems, identifiers may be used
   in policy decisions.

   It is important that systems be designed to take into account the
   possibility of devices reporting incorrect identifiers (either
   accidentally or maliciously) and the manipulation of identifiers in
   communications by illegitimate entities.  Integrity protection of
   communications or data objects, the use of trusted devices, and
   various management practices can help address these issues.

   Similar to the advice in <a href="/doc/html/rfc4122#section-6">[RFC4122], Section&nbsp;6</a>: Do not assume that DEV
   URNs are hard to guess.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   Per this document, IANA has registered a new URN namespace for &quot;dev&quot;,
   as described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   IANA has created a &quot;DEV URN Subtypes&quot; registry under &quot;Device
   Identification&quot;.  The initial values in this registry are as follows:

                                  Table 2

   Additional subtypes for DEV URNs can be defined through Specification
   Required or IESG Approval [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>].  These allocations are
   appropriate when there is a new namespace of some type of device
   identifier that is defined in a stable fashion and has a publicly
   available specification.

   Note that the organization (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>) device identifiers can also
   be used in some cases, at least as a temporary measure.  It is
   preferable, however, that long-term usage of a broadly employed
   device identifier be registered with IETF rather than used through
   the organization device identifier type.
