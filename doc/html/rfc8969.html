  <span class="h1">A Framework for Automating Service and Network Management with YANG</span>

Abstract

   Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services and
   networks.  Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration
   information for network and service components, and state information
   that will be monitored and tracked.  Data models can be used during
   the service and network management life cycle (e.g., service
   instantiation, service provisioning, service optimization, service
   monitoring, service diagnosing, and service assurance).  Data models
   are also instrumental in the automation of network management, and
   they can provide closed-loop control for adaptive and deterministic
   service creation, delivery, and maintenance.

   This document describes a framework for service and network
   management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling
   technologies.  This framework is drawn from a network operator
   perspective irrespective of the origin of a data model; thus, it can
   accommodate YANG modules that are developed outside the IETF.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Service management systems usually comprise service activation/
   provision and service operation.  Current service delivery
   procedures, from the processing of customer requirements and orders
   to service delivery and operation, typically assume the manipulation
   of data sequentially into multiple Operations Support System (OSS) or
   Business Support System (BSS) applications that may be managed by
   different departments within the service provider&#x27;s organization
   (e.g., billing factory, design factory, network operation center).
   Many of these applications have been developed in house over the
   years and operate in a silo mode.  As a result:

   *  The lack of standard data input/output (i.e., data model) raises
      many challenges in system integration and often results in manual
      configuration tasks.

   *  Service fulfillment systems might have a limited visibility on the
      network state and may therefore have a slow response to network
      changes.

   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) becomes crucial to address these
   challenges.  SDN techniques are meant to automate the overall service
   delivery procedures and typically rely upon standard data models.
   These models are used not only to reflect service providers&#x27; savoir
   faire, but also to dynamically instantiate and enforce a set of
   service-inferred policies that best accommodate what has been defined
   and possibly negotiated with the customer.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7149" title="&quot;Software-Defined Networking: A Perspective from within a Service Provider Environment&quot;">RFC7149</a>] provides a
   first tentative attempt to rationalize that service provider&#x27;s view
   on the SDN space by identifying concrete technical domains that need
   to be considered and for which solutions can be provided.  These
   include:

   *  Techniques for the dynamic discovery of topology, devices, and
      capabilities, along with relevant information and data models that
      are meant to precisely document such topology, devices, and their
      capabilities.

   *  Techniques for exposing network services [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8309" title="&quot;Service Models Explained&quot;">RFC8309</a>] and their
      characteristics.

   *  Techniques used by service-derived dynamic resource allocation and
      policy enforcement schemes, so that networks can be programmed
      accordingly.

   *  Dynamic feedback mechanisms that are meant to assess how
      efficiently a given policy (or a set thereof) is enforced from a
      service fulfillment and assurance perspective.

   Models are key for each of the four technical items above.  Service
   and network management automation is an important step to improve the
   agility of network operations.  Models are also important to ease
   integrating multi-vendor solutions.

   YANG module [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7950" title="&quot;The YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language&quot;">RFC7950</a>] developers have taken both top-down and bottom-
   up approaches to develop modules [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8199" title="&quot;YANG Module Classification&quot;">RFC8199</a>] and to establish a mapping
   between a network technology and customer requirements at the top or
   abstracting common constructs from various network technologies at
   the bottom.  At the time of writing this document (2020), there are
   many YANG data models, including configuration and service models,
   that have been specified or are being specified by the IETF.  They
   cover many of the networking protocols and techniques.  However, how
   these models work together to configure a function, manage a set of
   devices involved in a service, or provide a service is something that
   is not currently documented either within the IETF or other Standards
   Development Organizations (SDOs).

   Many of the YANG modules listed in this document are used to exchange
   data between NETCONF/RESTCONF clients and servers [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6241" title="&quot;Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)&quot;">RFC6241</a>][RFC8040].
   Nevertheless, YANG is a transport-independent data modeling language.
   It can thus be used independently of NETCONF/RESTCONF.  For example,
   YANG can be used to define abstract data structures [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8791" title="&quot;YANG Data Structure Extensions&quot;">RFC8791</a>] that
   can be manipulated by other protocols (e.g., [<a href="#ref-DOTS-DDOS">DOTS-DDOS</a>]).

   This document describes an architectural framework for service and
   network management automation (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) that takes advantage of
   YANG modeling technologies and investigates how YANG data models at
   different layers interact with each other (e.g., Service Mapping,
   model composition) in the context of service delivery and fulfillment
   (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).  Concretely, the following benefits can be provided:

   *  Vendor-agnostic interfaces managing a service and the underlying
      network are allowed.

   *  Movement from deployment schemes where vendor-specific network
      managers are required to a scheme where the entities that are
      responsible for orchestrating and controlling services and network
      resources provided by multi-vendor devices are unified is allowed.

   *  Data inheritance and reusability among the various architecture
      layers thus promoting a network-wise provisioning instead of
      device-specific configuration is eased.

   *  Dynamically feeding a decision-making process (e.g., Controllers,
      Orchestrators) with notifications that will trigger appropriate
      actions, allowing that decision-making process to continuously
      adjust a network (and thus the involved resources) to deliver the
      service that conforms to the intended parameters (service
      objectives) is allowed.

   This framework is drawn from a network operator perspective
   irrespective of the origin of a data model; it can also accommodate
   YANG modules that are developed outside the IETF.  The document
   covers service models that are used by an operator to expose its
   services and capture service requirements from the customers
   (including other operators).  Nevertheless, the document does not
   elaborate on the communication protocol(s) that makes use of these
   service models in order to request and deliver a service.  Such
   considerations are out of scope.

   The document identifies a list of use cases to exemplify the proposed
   approach (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), but it does not claim nor aim to be exhaustive.
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> lists some examples to illustrate the layered YANG modules
   view.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The following terms are defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8309" title="&quot;Service Models Explained&quot;">RFC8309</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8199" title="&quot;YANG Module Classification&quot;">RFC8199</a>] and are
   not redefined here:

   *  Network Operator

   *  Customer

   *  Service

   *  Data Model

   *  Service Model

   *  Network Element Model

   In addition, the document makes use of the following terms:

   Network Model:
      Describes a network-level abstraction (or a subset of aspects of a
      network infrastructure), including devices and their subsystems,
      and relevant protocols operating at the link and network layers
      across multiple devices.  This model corresponds to the network
      configuration model discussed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8309" title="&quot;Service Models Explained&quot;">RFC8309</a>].

      It can be used by a network operator to allocate resources (e.g.,
      tunnel resource, topology resource) for the service or schedule
      resources to meet the service requirements defined in a service
      model.

   Network Domain:
      Refers to a network partitioning that is usually followed by
      network operators to delimit parts of their network. &quot;access

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Data Models: Layering and Representation</span>

   As described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8199#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of [RFC8199]</a>, layering of modules allows
   for better reusability of lower-layer modules by higher-level modules
   while limiting duplication of features across layers.

   Data models in the context of network management can be classified
   into service, network, and device models.  Different service models
   may rely on the same set of network and/or device models.

   Service models traditionally follow a top-down approach and are
   mostly customer-facing YANG modules providing a common model
   construct for higher-level network services (e.g., Layer 3 Virtual
   Private Network (L3VPN)).  Such modules can be mapped to network
   technology-specific modules at lower layers (e.g., tunnel, routing,
   Quality of Service (QoS), security).  For example, service models can
   be used to characterize the network service(s) to be ensured between
   service nodes (ingress/egress) such as:

   *  the communication scope (pipe, hose, funnel, etc.),
   *  the directionality (inbound/outbound),
   *  the traffic performance guarantees expressed using metrics such as
      One-Way Delay (OWD) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7679" title="&quot;A One-Way Delay Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)&quot;">RFC7679</a>] or One-Way Loss [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7680" title="&quot;A One-Way Loss Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)&quot;">RFC7680</a>]; a summary
      of performance metrics maintained by IANA can be found in [<a href="#ref-IPPM" title="&quot;Performance Metrics&quot;">IPPM</a>],
   *  link capacity [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5136" title="&quot;Defining Network Capacity&quot;">RFC5136</a>] [<a href="#ref-METRIC-METHOD">METRIC-METHOD</a>],
   *  etc.

   Figure 1 depicts the example of a Voice over IP (VoIP) service that
   relies upon connectivity services offered by a network operator.  In
   this example, the VoIP service is offered to the network operator&#x27;s
   customers by Service Provider 1 (SP1).  In order to provide global
   VoIP reachability, SP1 Service Site interconnects with other Service
   Providers service sites typically by interconnecting Session Border
   Elements (SBEs) and Data Border Elements (DBEs) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5486" title="&quot;Session Peering for Multimedia Interconnect (SPEERMINT) Terminology&quot;">RFC5486</a>][RFC6406].
   For other VoIP destinations, sessions are forwarded over the
   Internet.  These connectivity services can be captured in a YANG
   service model that reflects the service attributes that are shown in
   Figure 2.  This example follows the IP Connectivity Provisioning
   Profile template defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7297" title="&quot;IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)&quot;">RFC7297</a>].

   Network models are mainly network-resource-facing modules; they
   describe various aspects of a network infrastructure, including
   devices and their subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the
   link and network layers across multiple devices (e.g., network
   topology and traffic-engineering tunnel modules).

   Device (and function) models usually follow a bottom-up approach and
   are mostly technology-specific modules used to realize a service
   (e.g., BGP, ACL).

   Each level maintains a view of the supported YANG modules provided by
   lower levels (see for example, <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).  Mechanisms such as the
   YANG library [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8525" title="&quot;YANG Library&quot;">RFC8525</a>] can be used to expose which YANG modules are
   supported by nodes in lower levels.

   Figure 3 illustrates the overall layering model.  The reader may
   refer to <a href="/doc/html/rfc8309#section-4">Section&nbsp;4 of [RFC8309]</a> for an overview of &quot;Orchestrator&quot; and
   &quot;Controller&quot; elements.  All these elements (i.e., Orchestrator(s),
   Controller(s), device(s)) are under the responsibility of the same
   operator.

      Figure 3: Layering and Representation within a Network Operator


   A composite service offered by a network operator may rely on
   services from other operators.  In such a case, the network operator
   acts as a customer to request services from other networks.  The
   operators providing these services will then follow the layering
   depicted in Figure 3.  The mapping between a composite service and a
   third-party service is maintained at the orchestration level.  From a
   data-plane perspective, appropriate traffic steering policies (e.g.,
   Service Function Chaining [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7665" title="&quot;Service Function Chaining (SFC) Architecture&quot;">RFC7665</a>]) are managed by the network
   controllers to guide how/when a third-party service is invoked for
   flows bound to a composite service.

   The layering model depicted in Figure 3 does not make any assumption
   about the location of the various entities (e.g., Controller,
   Orchestrator) within the network.  As such, the architecture does not
   preclude deployments where, for example, the Controller is embedded
   on a device that hosts other functions that are controlled via YANG
   modules.

   In order to ease the mapping between layers and data reuse, this
   document focuses on service models that are modeled using YANG.
   Nevertheless, fully compliant with <a href="/doc/html/rfc8309#section-3">Section&nbsp;3 of [RFC8309]</a>, Figure 3
   does not preclude service models to be modeled using data modeling
   languages other than YANG.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Automation of Service Delivery Procedures</span>

   Service models can be used by a network operator to expose its
   services to its customers.  Exposing such models allows automation of
   the activation of service orders and thus the service delivery.  One
   or more monolithic service models can be used in the context of a
   composite service activation request (e.g., delivery of a caching
   infrastructure over a VPN).  Such models are used to feed a decision-
   making intelligence to adequately accommodate customer needs.

   Also, such models may be used jointly with services that require
   dynamic invocation.  An example is provided by the service modules
   defined by the DOTS WG to dynamically trigger requests to handle
   Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8783" title="&quot;Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Data Channel Specification&quot;">RFC8783</a>].  The service
   filtering request modeled using [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8783" title="&quot;Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Data Channel Specification&quot;">RFC8783</a>] will be translated into
   device-specific filtering (e.g., ACLs defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8519" title="&quot;YANG Data Model for Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)&quot;">RFC8519</a>]) that
   fulfills the service request.

   Network models can be derived from service models and used to
   provision, monitor, and instantiate the service.  Also, they are used
   to provide life-cycle management of network resources.  Doing so is
   meant to:

   *  expose network resources to customers (including other network
      operators) to provide service fulfillment and assurance.

   *  allow customers (or network operators) to dynamically adjust the
      network resources based on service requirements as described in
      service models (e.g., Figure 2) and the current network
      performance information described in the telemetry modules.

   Note that it is out of the scope of this document to elaborate on the
   communication protocols that are used to implement the interface
   between the service ordering (customer) and service order handling
   (provider).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Service Fulfillment Automation</span>

   To operate a service, the settings of the parameters in the device
   models are derived from service models and/or network models and are
   used to:

   *  Provision each involved network function/device with the proper
      configuration information.

   *  Operate the network based on service requirements as described in
      the service model(s) and local operational guidelines.

   In addition, the operational state including configuration that is in
   effect together with statistics should be exposed to upper layers to
   provide better network visibility and assess to what extent the
   derived low-level modules are consistent with the upper-level inputs.

   Filters are enforced on the notifications that are communicated to
   Service layers.  The type and frequency of notifications may be
   agreed upon in the service model.

   Note that it is important to correlate telemetry data with
   configuration data to be used for closed loops at the different
   stages of service delivery, from resource allocation to service
   operation, in particular.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  YANG Module Integration</span>

   To support top-down service delivery, YANG modules at different
   levels or at the same level need to be integrated for proper service
   delivery (including proper network setup).  For example, the service
   parameters captured in service models need to be decomposed into a
   set of configuration/notification parameters that may be specific to
   one or more technologies; these technology-specific parameters are
   grouped together to define technology-specific device-level models or
   network-level models.

   In addition, these technology-specific device or network models can
   be further integrated with each other using the schema mount
   mechanism [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8528" title="&quot;YANG Schema Mount&quot;">RFC8528</a>] to provision each involved network function/
   device or each involved network domain to support newly added modules
   or features.  A collection of integrated device models can be loaded
   and validated during implementation.

   High-level policies can be defined at service or network models
   (e.g., &quot;Autonomous System Number (ASN) Exclude&quot; in the example
   depicted in Figure 2).  Device models will be tweaked accordingly to
   provide policy-based management.  Policies can also be used for
   telemetry automation, e.g., policies that contain conditions to
   trigger the generation and pushing of new telemetry data.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Functional Blocks and Interactions</span>

   The architectural considerations described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> lead to the
   life-cycle management architecture illustrated in Figure 4 and
   described in the following subsections.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Service Life-Cycle Management Procedure</span>

   Service life-cycle management includes end-to-end service life-cycle
   management at the service level and technology-specific network life-
   cycle management at the network level.

   The end-to-end service life-cycle management is technology-
   independent service management and spans across multiple network
   domains and/or multiple layers while technology-specific service
   life-cycle management is technology domain-specific or layer-specific
   service life-cycle management.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Service Exposure</span>

   A service in the context of this document (sometimes called &quot;Network
   Service&quot;) is some form of connectivity between customer sites and the
   Internet or between customer sites across the operator&#x27;s network and
   across the Internet.

   Service exposure is used to capture services offered to customers
   (ordering and order handling).  One example is that a customer can
   use an L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) to request L3VPN service by
   providing the abstract technical characterization of the intended
   service between customer sites.

   Service model catalogs can be created to expose the various services
   and the information needed to invoke/order a given service.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.2" href="#section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  Service Creation/Modification</span>

   A customer is usually unaware of the technology that the network
   operator has available to deliver the service, so the customer does
   not make requests specific to the underlying technology but is
   limited to making requests specific to the service that is to be
   delivered.  This service request can be filled using a service model.

   Upon receiving a service request, and assuming that appropriate
   authentication and authorization checks have been made with success,
   the service Orchestrator/management system should verify whether the
   service requirements in the service request can be met (i.e., whether
   there are sufficient resources that can be allocated with the
   requested guarantees).

   If the request is accepted, the service Orchestrator/management
   system maps such a service request to its view.  This view can be
   described as a technology-specific network model or a set of
   technology-specific device models, and this mapping may include a
   choice of which networks and technologies to use depending on which
   service features have been requested.

   In addition, a customer may require a change in the underlying
   network infrastructure to adapt to new customers&#x27; needs and service
   requirements (e.g., service a new customer site, add a new access
   link, or provide disjoint paths).  This service modification can be
   issued following the same service model used by the service request.

   Withdrawing a service is discussed in <a href="#section-4.1.6">Section 4.1.6</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.3" href="#section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a>.  Service Assurance</span>

   The performance measurement telemetry (<a href="#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3</a>) can be used to
   provide service assurance at service and/or network levels.  The
   performance measurement telemetry model can tie with service or
   network models to monitor network performance or Service Level
   Agreements.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.4" href="#section-4.1.4">4.1.4</a>.  Service Optimization</span>

   Service optimization is a technique that gets the configuration of
   the network updated due to network changes, incident mitigation, or
   new service requirements.  One example is once a tunnel or a VPN is
   set up, performance monitoring information or telemetry information
   per tunnel (or per VPN) can be collected and fed into the management
   system.  If the network performance doesn&#x27;t meet the service
   requirements, the management system can create new VPN policies
   capturing network service requirements and populate them into the
   network.

   Both network performance information and policies can be modeled
   using YANG.  With Policy-based management, self-configuration and
   self-optimization behavior can be specified and implemented.

   The overall service optimization is managed at the service level,
   while the network level is responsible for the optimization of the
   specific network services it provides.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.5" href="#section-4.1.5">4.1.5</a>.  Service Diagnosis</span>

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions for service diagnosis that allow network
   operators to:

   *  monitor network communications (i.e., reachability verification
      and Continuity Check)

   *  troubleshoot failures (i.e., fault verification and localization)

   *  monitor service level agreements and performance (i.e.,
      performance management)

   When the network is down, service diagnosis should be in place to
   pinpoint the problem and provide recommendations (or instructions)
   for network recovery.

   The service diagnosis information can be modeled as technology-
   independent Remote Procedure Call (RPC) operations for OAM protocols
   and technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for OAM
   protocols [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8531" title="&quot;Generic YANG Data Model for Connection-Oriented Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Protocols&quot;">RFC8531</a>][RFC8533].  These models can be used to provide
   consistent configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM
   mechanisms used to manage the network.

   Refer to <a href="#section-4.2.4">Section 4.2.4</a> for the device-specific side.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.6" href="#section-4.1.6">4.1.6</a>.  Service Decommission</span>

   Service decommission allows a customer to stop the service by
   removing the service from active status, thus releasing the network
   resources that were allocated to the service.  Customers can also use
   the service model to withdraw the subscription to a service.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Service Fulfillment Management Procedure</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2.1" href="#section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Intended Configuration Provision</span>

   Intended configuration at the device level is derived from network
   models at the network level or service models at the service level
   and represents the configuration that the system attempts to apply.
   Take L3SM as a service model example to deliver an L3VPN service;
   there is a need to map the L3VPN service view defined in the service
   model into a detailed intended configuration view defined by specific
   configuration models for network elements.  The configuration
   information includes:

   *  Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) definition, including VPN
      policy expression

   *  Physical Interface(s)

   *  IP layer (IPv4, IPv6)

   *  QoS features such as classification, profiles, etc.

   *  Routing protocols: support of configuration of all protocols
      listed in a service request, as well as routing policies
      associated with those protocols

   *  Multicast support

   *  Address sharing

   *  Security (e.g., access control, authentication, encryption)

   These specific configuration models can be used to configure Provider
   Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE) devices within a site, e.g., a BGP
   policy model can be used to establish VPN membership between sites
   and VPN service topology.

   Note that in networks with legacy devices (that support proprietary
   modules or do not support YANG at all), an adaptation layer is likely
   to be required at the network level so that these devices can be
   involved in the delivery of the network services.

   This interface is also used to handle service withdrawal
   (<a href="#section-4.1.6">Section 4.1.6</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2.2" href="#section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.  Configuration Validation</span>

   Configuration validation is used to validate intended configuration
   and ensure the configuration takes effect.

   For example, if a customer creates an interface &quot;eth-0/0/0&quot; but the
   interface does not physically exist at this point, then configuration
   data appears in the &lt;intended&gt; status but does not appear in the
   &lt;operational&gt; datastore.  More details about &lt;intended&gt; and
   &lt;operational&gt; datastores can be found in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8342#section-5.1">Section&nbsp;5.1 of [RFC8342]</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2.3" href="#section-4.2.3">4.2.3</a>.  Performance Monitoring</span>

   When a configuration is in effect in a device, the &lt;operational&gt;
   datastore holds the complete operational state of the device,
   including learned, system, default configuration, and system state.
   However, the configurations and state of a particular device do not
   have visibility on the whole network, nor can they show how packets
   are going to be forwarded through the entire network.  Therefore, it
   becomes more difficult to operate the entire network without
   understanding the current status of the network.

   The management system should subscribe to updates of a YANG datastore
   in all the network devices for performance monitoring purposes and
   build a full topological visibility of the network by aggregating
   (and filtering) these operational states from different sources.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2.4" href="#section-4.2.4">4.2.4</a>.  Fault Diagnostic</span>

   When configuration is in effect in a device, some devices may be
   misconfigured (e.g., device links are not consistent in both sides of
   the network connection) or network resources might be misallocated.
   Therefore, services may be negatively affected without knowing the
   root cause in the network.

   Technology-dependent nodes and RPC commands are defined in
   technology-specific YANG data models, which can use and extend the
   base model described in <a href="#section-4.1.5">Section 4.1.5</a> to deal with these issues.

   These RPC commands received in the technology-dependent node can be
   used to trigger technology-specific OAM message exchanges for fault
   verification and fault isolation.  For example, Transparent
   Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Multi-destination Tree
   Verification (MTV) RPC command [<a href="#ref-TRILL-YANG-OAM">TRILL-YANG-OAM</a>] can be used to
   trigger Multi-Destination Tree Verification Messages (MTVMs) defined
   in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7455" title="&quot;Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Fault Management&quot;">RFC7455</a>] to verify TRILL distribution tree integrity.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Multi-layer/Multi-domain Service Mapping</span>

   Multi-layer/Multi-domain Service Mapping allows the mapping of an
   end-to-end abstract view of the service segmented at different layers
   and/or different network domains into domain-specific views.

   One example is to map service parameters in the L3SM into
   configuration parameters such as Route Distinguisher (RD), Route
   Target (RT), and VRF in the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM).

   Another example is to map service parameters in the L3SM into Traffic
   Engineered (TE) tunnel parameters (e.g., Tunnel ID) in TE model and
   Virtual Network (VN) parameters (e.g., Access Point (AP) list and VN
   members) in the YANG data model for VN operation [<a href="#ref-ACTN-VN-YANG">ACTN-VN-YANG</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Service Decomposition</span>

   Service Decomposition allows to decompose service models at the
   service level or network models at the network level into a set of
   device models at the device level.  These device models may be tied
   to specific device types or classified into a collection of related
   YANG modules based on service types and features offered, and they
   may load at the implementation time before configuration is loaded
   and validated.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  YANG Data Model Integration Examples</span>

   The following subsections provide some YANG data model integration
   examples.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  L2VPN/L3VPN Service Delivery</span>

   In reference to Figure 5, the following steps are performed to
   deliver the L3VPN service within the network management automation
   architecture defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>:

   1.  The Customer requests to create two sites (as per Service
       Creation in <a href="#section-4.1.2">Section 4.1.2</a>) relying upon L3SM with each site
       having one network access connectivity, for example:

       *  Site A: network-access A, link-capacity = 20 Mbps, class
          &quot;foo&quot;, guaranteed-capacity-percent = 10, average-one-way-delay
          = 70 ms.

       *  Site B: network-access B, link-capacity = 30 Mbps, class
          &quot;foo1&quot;, guaranteed-capacity-percent = 15, average-one-way-
          delay = 60 ms.

   2.  The Orchestrator extracts the service parameters from the L3SM.
       Then, it uses them as input to the Service Mapping in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>
       to translate them into orchestrated configuration parameters
       (e.g., RD, RT, and VRF) that are part of the L3NM specified in
       [<a href="#ref-OPSAWG-L3SM-L3NM">OPSAWG-L3SM-L3NM</a>].

   3.  The Controller takes the orchestrated configuration parameters in
       the L3NM and translates them into an orchestrated (Service
       Decomposition in <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>) configuration of network elements
       that are part of, e.g., BGP, QoS, Network Instance, IP
       management, and interface models.

   [<a id="ref-UNI-TOPOLOGY">UNI-TOPOLOGY</a>] can be used for representing, managing, and
   controlling the User Network Interface (UNI) topology.

             Figure 5: L3VPN Service Delivery Example (Current)

   L3NM inherits some of the data elements from the L3SM.  Nevertheless,
   the L3NM as designed in [<a href="#ref-OPSAWG-L3SM-L3NM">OPSAWG-L3SM-L3NM</a>] does not expose some
   information to the above layer such as the capabilities of an
   underlying network (which can be used to drive service order
   handling) or notifications (to notify subscribers about specific
   events or degradations as per agreed SLAs).  Some of this information
   can be provided using, e.g., [<a href="#ref-OPSAWG-YANG-VPN">OPSAWG-YANG-VPN</a>].  A target overall

             Figure 6: L3VPN Service Delivery Example (Target)

   Note that a similar analysis can be performed for Layer 2 VPNs
   (L2VPNs).  An L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) is defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8466" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) Service Delivery&quot;">RFC8466</a>],
   while the YANG L2VPN Network Model (L2NM) is specified in
   [<a href="#ref-OPSAWG-L2NM">OPSAWG-L2NM</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  VN Life-Cycle Management</span>

   In reference to Figure 7, the following steps are performed to
   deliver the VN service within the network management automation
   architecture defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>:

   1.  A customer makes a request (Service Exposure in <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>) to
       create a VN.  The association between the VN, APs, and VN members
       is defined in the VN YANG model [<a href="#ref-ACTN-VN-YANG">ACTN-VN-YANG</a>].

   2.  The Orchestrator creates the single abstract node topology based
       on the information captured in the request.

   3.  The customer exchanges with the Orchestrator the connectivity
       matrix on the abstract node topology and explicit paths using the
       TE topology model [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8795" title="&quot;YANG Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies&quot;">RFC8795</a>].  This information can be used to
       instantiate the VN and set up tunnels between source and
       destination endpoints (Service Creation in <a href="#section-4.1.2">Section 4.1.2</a>).

   4.  In order to provide service assurance (Service Optimization in
       <a href="#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4</a>), the telemetry model that augments the VN model
       and corresponding TE tunnel model can be used by the Orchestrator
       to subscribe to performance measurement data.  The Controller
       will then notify the Orchestrator with all the parameter changes
       and network performance changes related to the VN topology and
       the tunnels [<a href="#ref-TEAS-ACTN-PM">TEAS-ACTN-PM</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Event-Based Telemetry in the Device Self Management</span>

   In reference to Figure 8, the following steps are performed to
   monitor state changes of managed resources in a network device and
   provide device self management within the network management
   automation architecture defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>:

   1.  To control which state a network device should be in or is
       allowed to be in at any given time, a set of conditions and
       actions are defined and correlated with network events (e.g.,
       allow the NETCONF server to send updates only when the value
       exceeds a certain threshold for the first time, but not again
       until the threshold is cleared), which constitute an Event
       Condition Action (ECA) policy or an event-driven policy control
       logic that can be executed on the device (e.g., [<a href="#ref-EVENT-YANG">EVENT-YANG</a>]).

   2.  To provide a rapid autonomic response that can exhibit self-
       management properties, the Controller pushes the ECA policy to
       the network device and delegates the network control logic to the
       network device.

   3.  The network device uses the ECA model to subscribe to the event
       source, e.g., an event stream or datastore state data conveyed to
       the server via YANG-Push subscription [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8641" title="&quot;Subscription to YANG Notifications for Datastore Updates&quot;">RFC8641</a>], monitors state
       parameters, and takes simple and instant actions when an
       associated event condition on state parameters is met.  ECA
       notifications can be generated as the result of actions based on
       event stream subscription or datastore subscription (model-driven
       telemetry operation discussed in <a href="#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Many of the YANG modules cited in this document define schema for
   data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols
   such as NETCONF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6241" title="&quot;Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)&quot;">RFC6241</a>] or RESTCONF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8040" title="&quot;RESTCONF Protocol&quot;">RFC8040</a>].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6242" title="&quot;Using the NETCONF Protocol over Secure Shell (SSH)&quot;">RFC6242</a>].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8446" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">RFC8446</a>].

   The NETCONF access control model [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8341" title="&quot;Network Configuration Access Control Model&quot;">RFC8341</a>] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   Security considerations specific to each of the technologies and
   protocols listed in the document are discussed in the specification
   documents of each of these protocols.

   In order to prevent leaking sensitive information and the &quot;confused
   deputy&quot; problem [<a href="#ref-Hardy" title="&quot;The Confused Deputy: (or why capabilities might have been invented)&quot;">Hardy</a>] in general, special care should be considered
   when translating between the various layers in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> or when
   aggregating data retrieved from various sources.  Authorization and
   authentication checks should be performed to ensure that data is
   available to an authorized entity.  The network operator must enforce
   means to protect privacy-related information included in customer-
   facing models.

   To detect misalignment between layers that might be induced by
   misbehaving nodes, upper layers should continuously monitor the
   perceived service (<a href="#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4</a>) and should proceed with checks to
   assess that the provided service complies with the expected service
   and that the data reported by an underlying layer is matching the
   perceived service by the above layer.  Such checks are the
   responsibility of the service diagnosis (<a href="#section-4.1.5">Section 4.1.5</a>).

   When a YANG module includes security-related parameters, it is
   recommended to include the relevant information as part of the
   service assurance to track the correct functioning of the security
   mechanisms.

   Additional considerations are discussed in the following subsections.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Service Level</span>

   A provider may rely on services offered by other providers to build
   composite services.  Appropriate mechanisms should be enabled by the
   provider to monitor and detect a service disruption from these
   providers.  The characterization of a service disruption (including
   mean time between failures and mean time to repair), the escalation
   procedure, and penalties are usually documented in contractual
   agreements (e.g., as described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc4176#section-2.1">Section&nbsp;2.1 of [RFC4176]</a>).
   Misbehaving peer providers will thus be identified and appropriate
   countermeasures will be applied.

   The communication protocols that make use of a service model between
   a customer and an operator are out of scope.  Relevant security
   considerations should be discussed in the specification documents of
   these protocols.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Network Level</span>

   Security considerations specific to the network level are listed
   below:

   *  A controller may create forwarding loops by misconfiguring the
      underlying network nodes.  It is recommended to proceed with tests
      to check the status of forwarding paths regularly or whenever
      changes are made to routing or forwarding processes.  Such checks
      may be triggered from the service level owing to the means
      discussed in <a href="#section-4.1.5">Section 4.1.5</a>.

   *  Some service models may include a traffic isolation clause that is
      passed down to the network level so that appropriate technology-
      specific actions must be enforced at the underlying network (and
      thus involved network devices) to avoid that such traffic is
      accessible to non-authorized parties.  In particular, network
      models may indicate whether encryption is enabled and, if so,
      expose a list of supported encryption schemes and parameters.
      Refer, for example, to the encryption feature defined in
      [<a href="#ref-OPSAWG-VPN-COMMON">OPSAWG-VPN-COMMON</a>] and its use in [<a href="#ref-OPSAWG-L3SM-L3NM">OPSAWG-L3SM-L3NM</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.3" href="#section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Device Level</span>

   Network operators should monitor and audit their networks to detect
   misbehaving nodes and abnormal behaviors.  For example, OAM, as
   discussed in <a href="#section-4.1.5">Section 4.1.5</a>, can be used for that purpose.

   Access to some data requires specific access privilege levels.
   Devices must check that a required access privilege is provided
   before granting access to specific data or performing specific
   actions.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Layered YANG Module Examples Overview</span>

   This appendix lists a set of YANG data models that can be used for
   the delivery of connectivity services.  These models can be
   classified as service, network, or device models.

   It is not the intent of this appendix to provide an inventory of
   tools and mechanisms used in specific network and service management
   domains; such inventory can be found in documents such as [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7276" title="&quot;An Overview of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools&quot;">RFC7276</a>].

   The reader may refer to the YANG Catalog
   (&lt;<a href="https://www.yangcatalog.org">https://www.yangcatalog.org</a>&gt;) or the public Github YANG repository
   (&lt;<a href="https://github.com/YangModels/yang">https://github.com/YangModels/yang</a>&gt;) to query existing YANG models.
   The YANG Catalog includes some metadata to indicate the module type
   (&#x27;module-classification&#x27;) [<a href="#ref-NETMOD-MODEL">NETMOD-MODEL</a>].  Note that the mechanism
   defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8819" title="&quot;YANG Module Tags&quot;">RFC8819</a>] allows to associate tags with YANG modules in
   order to help classifying the modules.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.1" href="#appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Service Models: Definition and Samples</span>

   As described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8309" title="&quot;Service Models Explained&quot;">RFC8309</a>], the service is &quot;some form of connectivity
   between customer sites and the Internet or between customer sites
   across the network operator&#x27;s network and across the Internet&quot;.  More
   concretely, an IP connectivity service can be defined as the IP
   transfer capability characterized by a (Source Nets, Destination
   Nets, Guarantees, Scope) tuple where &quot;Source Nets&quot; is a group of
   unicast IP addresses, &quot;Destination Nets&quot; is a group of IP unicast
   and/or multicast addresses, and &quot;Guarantees&quot; reflects the guarantees
   (expressed, for example, in terms of QoS, performance, and
   availability) to properly forward traffic to the said &quot;Destination&quot;
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7297" title="&quot;IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)&quot;">RFC7297</a>].  The &quot;Scope&quot; denotes the network perimeter (e.g., between
   Provider Edge (PE) routers or Customer Nodes) where the said
   guarantees need to be provided.

   For example:

   *  The L3SM [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8299" title="&quot;YANG Data Model for L3VPN Service Delivery&quot;">RFC8299</a>] defines the L3VPN service ordered by a customer
      from a network operator.

   *  The L2SM [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8466" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) Service Delivery&quot;">RFC8466</a>] defines the L2VPN service ordered by a customer
      from a network operator.

   *  The Virtual Network (VN) model [<a href="#ref-ACTN-VN-YANG">ACTN-VN-YANG</a>] provides a YANG data
      model applicable to any mode of VN operation.

   L2SM and L3SM are customer service models as per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8309" title="&quot;Service Models Explained&quot;">RFC8309</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.2" href="#appendix-A.2">A.2</a>.  Schema Mount</span>

   Modularity and extensibility were among the leading design principles
   of the YANG data modeling language.  As a result, the same YANG
   module can be combined with various sets of other modules and thus
   form a data model that is tailored to meet the requirements of a
   specific use case.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8528" title="&quot;YANG Schema Mount&quot;">RFC8528</a>] defines a mechanism, denoted &quot;schema
   mount&quot;, that allows for mounting one data model consisting of any
   number of YANG modules at a specified location of another (parent)
   schema.

   network models.

              Figure 9: Sample Resource-Facing Network Models


   Examples of topology YANG modules are listed below:

      manipulating TE topologies.

      This module is extended from the network topology model defined in
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8345" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Network Topologies&quot;">RFC8345</a>] and includes content related to TE topologies.  This
      model contains technology-agnostic TE topology building blocks
      that can be augmented and used by other technology-specific TE
      topology models.

      related to Layer 3 topology specifics.

   Layer 2 Topology Model:
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8944" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Layer 2 Network Topologies&quot;">RFC8944</a>] defines a YANG data model for representing and
      manipulating Layer 2 topologies.  This model is extended from the
      network topology model defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8345" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Network Topologies&quot;">RFC8345</a>] and includes content
      related to Layer 2 topology specifics.

   Examples of tunnel YANG modules are provided below:

   Tunnel Identities:
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8675" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Tunnel Interface Types&quot;">RFC8675</a>] defines a collection of YANG identities used as
      interface types for tunnel interfaces.

   TE Tunnel Model:
      [<a href="#ref-TEAS-YANG-TE">TEAS-YANG-TE</a>] defines a YANG module for the configuration and
      management of TE interfaces, tunnels, and LSPs.

   Segment Routing (SR) Traffic Engineering (TE) Tunnel Model:
      [<a href="#ref-TEAS-YANG-TE">TEAS-YANG-TE</a>] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE model(s) and
      defines a YANG module for SR-TE-specific data.

   MPLS-TE Model:
      [<a href="#ref-TEAS-YANG-TE">TEAS-YANG-TE</a>] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE model(s) and
      defines a YANG module for MPLS-TE configurations, state, RPC, and
      notifications.

   RSVP-TE MPLS Model:
      [<a href="#ref-TEAS-YANG-RSVP">TEAS-YANG-RSVP</a>] augments the RSVP-TE generic module with
      parameters to configure and manage signaling of MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs.

   Other sample network models are listed hereafter:

      that complements the stateful solution defined in [<a href="#ref-TEAS-YANG-TE">TEAS-YANG-TE</a>].

   OAM Models (including Fault Management (FM) and Performance
   Monitoring):
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8532" title="&quot;Generic YANG Data Model for the Management of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Protocols That Use Connectionless Communications&quot;">RFC8532</a>] defines a base YANG module for the management of OAM
      protocols that use Connectionless Communications.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8533" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Retrieval Methods for the Management of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Protocols That Use Connectionless Communications&quot;">RFC8533</a>]
      defines a retrieval method YANG module for connectionless OAM
      protocols.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8531" title="&quot;Generic YANG Data Model for Connection-Oriented Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Protocols&quot;">RFC8531</a>] defines a base YANG module for connection-
      oriented OAM protocols.  These three models are intended to
      provide consistent reporting, configuration, and representation
      for connectionless OAM and connection-oriented OAM separately.

      Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
      Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the
      network services or necessarily point to the root cause.
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8632" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management&quot;">RFC8632</a>] defines a YANG module for alarm management.

   Network Element models (listed in Figure 10) are used to describe how
   a service can be implemented by activating and tweaking a set of
   functions (enabled in one or multiple devices, or hosted in cloud
   infrastructures) that are involved in the service delivery.  For
   example, the L3VPN service will involve many PEs and require
   manipulating the following modules:

   *  Routing management [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8349" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Routing Management (NMDA Version)&quot;">RFC8349</a>]

   *  BGP [<a href="#ref-IDR-BGP-MODEL">IDR-BGP-MODEL</a>]

   *  PIM [<a href="#ref-PIM-YANG" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)&quot;">PIM-YANG</a>]

   *  NAT management [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8512" title="&quot;A YANG Module for Network Address Translation (NAT) and Network Prefix Translation (NPT)&quot;">RFC8512</a>]

   *  QoS management [<a href="#ref-QOS-MODEL">QOS-MODEL</a>]

   *  ACLs [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8519" title="&quot;YANG Data Model for Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)&quot;">RFC8519</a>]

   Figure 10 uses IETF-defined data models as an example.

      routing policies based on operational practice.  The module
      provides a generic policy framework that can be augmented with
      protocol-specific policy configuration.

   SR/SRv6:
      [<a href="#ref-SPRING-SR-YANG">SPRING-SR-YANG</a>] defines a YANG module for segment routing
      configuration and operation.

      protocol that is used for liveness detection of arbitrary paths
      between systems.  [<a href="#ref-BFD-YANG" title="&quot;YANG Data Model for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)&quot;">BFD-YANG</a>] defines a YANG module that can be
      used to configure and manage BFD.

   Multicast:
      [<a href="#ref-PIM-YANG" title="&quot;A YANG Data Model for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)&quot;">PIM-YANG</a>] defines a YANG module that can be used to configure and
      manage Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) devices.

      [<a id="ref-RFC8652">RFC8652</a>] defines a YANG module that can be used to configure and
      manage Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast
      Listener Discovery (MLD) devices.

      [<a id="ref-SNOOPING-YANG">SNOOPING-YANG</a>] defines a YANG module that can be used to
      configure and manage Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and
      Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping devices.

      [<a id="ref-MVPN-YANG">MVPN-YANG</a>] defines a YANG data model to configure and manage
      Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs (MVPNs).

   PM:
      [<a href="#ref-TWAMP-DATA-MODEL">TWAMP-DATA-MODEL</a>] defines a YANG data model for client and server
      implementations of the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
      (TWAMP).

      Session-Sender and Session-Reflector for Simple Two-way Active
      Measurement Protocol (STAMP) mode using YANG.

      [<a id="ref-RFC8194">RFC8194</a>] defines a YANG data model for Large-Scale Measurement
      Platforms (LMAPs).

   ACL:
      An Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements used to
      configure device-forwarding behavior.  It is used in many
      networking technologies such as Policy-Based Routing, firewalls,
      etc.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8519" title="&quot;YANG Data Model for Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)&quot;">RFC8519</a>] describes a YANG data model of ACL basic building
      blocks.

   QoS:
      [<a href="#ref-QOS-MODEL">QOS-MODEL</a>] describes a YANG module of Differentiated Services for
      configuration and operations.

   NAT:
      For the sake of network automation and the need for programming
      the Network Address Translation (NAT) function in particular, a
      YANG data model for configuring and managing the NAT is essential.

      [<a id="ref-RFC8512">RFC8512</a>] defines a YANG module for the NAT function covering a
      variety of NAT flavors such as Network Address Translation from
      IPv4 to IPv4 (NAT44), Network Address and Protocol Translation
