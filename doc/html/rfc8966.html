<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol that is
   designed to be robust and efficient both in networks using prefix-
   based routing and in networks using flat routing (&quot;mesh networks&quot;),
   and both in relatively stable wired networks and in highly dynamic
   wireless networks.  This document describes the Babel routing
   protocol and obsoletes [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6126" title="&quot;The Babel Routing Protocol&quot;">RFC6126</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7557" title="&quot;Extension Mechanism for the Babel Routing Protocol&quot;">RFC7557</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Features</span>

   The main property that makes Babel suitable for unstable networks is
   that, unlike naive distance-vector routing protocols [<a href="#ref-RIP" title="&quot;RIP Version 2&quot;">RIP</a>], it
   strongly limits the frequency and duration of routing pathologies
   such as routing loops and black-holes during reconvergence.  Even
   after a mobility event is detected, a Babel network usually remains
   loop-free.  Babel then quickly reconverges to a configuration that
   preserves the loop-freedom and connectedness of the network, but is
   not necessarily optimal; in many cases, this operation requires no
   packet exchanges at all.  Babel then slowly converges, in a time on
   the scale of minutes, to an optimal configuration.  This is achieved
   by using sequenced routes, a technique pioneered by Destination-
   Sequenced Distance-Vector routing [<a href="#ref-DSDV" title="&quot;Highly dynamic Destination- Sequenced Distance-Vector routing (DSDV) for mobile computers&quot;">DSDV</a>].

   More precisely, Babel has the following properties:

   *  when every prefix is originated by at most one router, Babel never
      suffers from routing loops;

   *  when a single prefix is originated by multiple routers, Babel may
      occasionally create a transient routing loop for this particular
      prefix; this loop disappears in time proportional to the loop&#x27;s
      diameter, and never again (up to an arbitrary garbage-collection
      (GC) time) will the routers involved participate in a routing loop
      for the same prefix;

   *  assuming bounded packet loss rates, any routing black-holes that
      may appear after a mobility event are corrected in a time at most
      proportional to the network&#x27;s diameter.

   Babel has provisions for link quality estimation and for fairly
   arbitrary metrics.  When configured suitably, Babel can implement
   shortest-path routing, or it may use a metric based, for example, on
   measured packet loss.

   Babel nodes will successfully establish an association even when they
   are configured with different parameters.  For example, a mobile node
   that is low on battery may choose to use larger time constants (hello
   and update intervals, etc.) than a node that has access to wall
   power.  Conversely, a node that detects high levels of mobility may
   choose to use smaller time constants.  The ability to build such
   heterogeneous networks makes Babel particularly adapted to the
   unmanaged or wireless environment.

   Finally, Babel is a hybrid routing protocol, in the sense that it can
   carry routes for multiple network-layer protocols (IPv4 and IPv6),
   regardless of which protocol the Babel packets are themselves being
   carried over.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Limitations</span>

   Babel has two limitations that make it unsuitable for use in some
   environments.  First, Babel relies on periodic routing table updates
   rather than using a reliable transport; hence, in large, stable
   networks it generates more traffic than protocols that only send
   updates when the network topology changes.  In such networks,
   protocols such as OSPF [<a href="#ref-OSPF" title="&quot;OSPF Version 2&quot;">OSPF</a>], IS-IS [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title="&quot;Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intra-domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)&quot;">IS-IS</a>], or the Enhanced
   Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) [<a href="#ref-EIGRP" title="&quot;EIGRP -- a Fast Routing Protocol Based on Distance Vectors&quot;">EIGRP</a>] might be more
   suitable.

   Second, unless the second algorithm described in <a href="#section-3.5.4">Section 3.5.4</a> is
   implemented, Babel does impose a hold time when a prefix is
   retracted.  While this hold time does not apply to the exact prefix
   being retracted, and hence does not prevent fast reconvergence should
   it become available again, it does apply to any shorter prefix that
   covers it.  This may make those implementations of Babel that do not
   implement the optional algorithm described in <a href="#section-3.5.4">Section 3.5.4</a>
   unsuitable for use in networks that implement automatic prefix
   aggregation.

   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Conceptual Description of the Protocol</span>

   Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector protocol: it is based on the
   Bellman-Ford algorithm, just like the venerable RIP [<a href="#ref-RIP" title="&quot;RIP Version 2&quot;">RIP</a>], but
   includes a number of refinements that either prevent loop formation
   altogether, or ensure that a loop disappears in a timely manner and
   doesn&#x27;t form again.

   Conceptually, Bellman-Ford is executed in parallel for every source
   of routing information (destination of data traffic).  In the
   following discussion, we fix a source S; the reader will recall that
   the same algorithm is executed for all sources.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Costs, Metrics, and Neighbourship</span>

   For every pair of neighbouring nodes A and B, Babel computes an
   abstract value known as the cost of the link from A to B, written
   C(A, B).  Given a route between any two (not necessarily
   neighbouring) nodes, the metric of the route is the sum of the costs
   of all the links along the route.  The goal of the routing algorithm
   is to compute, for every source S, the tree of routes of lowest
   metric to S.

   Costs and metrics need not be integers.  In general, they can be
   values in any algebra that satisfies two fairly general conditions
   (<a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>).

   A Babel node periodically sends Hello messages to all of its
   neighbours; it also periodically sends an IHU (&quot;I Heard You&quot;) message
   to every neighbour from which it has recently heard a Hello.  From
   the information derived from Hello and IHU messages received from its
   neighbour B, a node A computes the cost C(A, B) of the link from A to
   B.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  The Bellman-Ford Algorithm</span>

   Every node A maintains two pieces of data: its estimated distance to
   S, written D(A), and its next-hop router to S, written NH(A).
   Initially, D(S) = 0, D(A) is infinite, and NH(A) is undefined.

   Periodically, every node B sends to all of its neighbours a route
   update, a message containing D(B).  When a neighbour A of B receives
   the route update, it checks whether B is its selected next hop; if
   that is the case, then NH(A) is set to B, and D(A) is set to C(A, B)
   + D(B).  If that is not the case, then A compares C(A, B) + D(B) to
   its current value of D(A).  If that value is smaller, meaning that
   the received update advertises a route that is better than the
   currently selected route, then NH(A) is set to B, and D(A) is set to
   C(A, B) + D(B).

   A number of refinements to this algorithm are possible, and are used
   by Babel.  In particular, convergence speed may be increased by
   sending unscheduled &quot;triggered updates&quot; whenever a major change in
   the topology is detected, in addition to the regular, scheduled
   updates.  Additionally, a node may maintain a number of alternate
   routes, which are being advertised by neighbours other than its
   selected neighbour, and which can be used immediately if the selected
   route were to fail.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.3" href="#section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Transient Loops in Bellman-Ford</span>

   It is well known that a naive application of Bellman-Ford to
   distributed routing can cause transient loops after a topology
   change.  Consider for example the following topology:

            B
         1 /|
      1   / |
   S --- A  |1
          \ |
         1 \|
            C

   After convergence, D(B) = D(C) = 2, with NH(B) = NH(C) = A.

   Suppose now that the link between S and A fails:

            B
         1 /|
          / |
   S     A  |1
          \ |
         1 \|
            C

   When it detects the failure of the link, A switches its next hop to B
   (which is still advertising a route to S with metric 2), and
   advertises a metric equal to 3, and then advertises a new route with
   metric 3.  This process of nodes changing selected neighbours and
   increasing their metric continues until the advertised metric reaches
   &quot;infinity&quot;, a value larger than all the metrics that the routing
   protocol is able to carry.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.4" href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Feasibility Conditions</span>

   Bellman-Ford is a very robust algorithm: its convergence properties
   are preserved when routers delay route acquisition or when they
   discard some updates.  Babel routers discard received route
   announcements unless they can prove that accepting them cannot
   possibly cause a routing loop.

   More formally, we define a condition over route announcements, known
   as the &quot;feasibility condition&quot;, that guarantees the absence of
   routing loops whenever all routers ignore route updates that do not
   satisfy the feasibility condition.  In effect, this makes Bellman-
   Ford into a family of routing algorithms, parameterised by the
   feasibility condition.

   Many different feasibility conditions are possible.  For example, BGP
   can be modelled as being a distance-vector protocol with a (rather
   drastic) feasibility condition: a routing update is only accepted
   when the receiving node&#x27;s AS number is not included in the update&#x27;s
   AS_PATH attribute (note that BGP&#x27;s feasibility condition does not
   ensure the absence of transient &quot;micro-loops&quot; during reconvergence).

   Another simple feasibility condition, used in the Destination-
   Sequenced Distance-Vector (DSDV) routing protocol [<a href="#ref-DSDV" title="&quot;Highly dynamic Destination- Sequenced Distance-Vector routing (DSDV) for mobile computers&quot;">DSDV</a>] and in the
   Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3561" title="&quot;Ad hoc On- Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing&quot;">RFC3561</a>], stems
   from the following observation: a routing loop can only arise after a
   router has switched to a route with a larger metric than the route
   that it had previously selected.  Hence, one may define that a route
   is feasible when its metric at the local node would be no larger than
   the metric of the currently selected route, i.e., an announcement
   carrying a metric D(B) is accepted by A when C(A, B) + D(B) &lt;= D(A).
   If all routers obey this constraint, then the metric at every router
   is nonincreasing, and the following invariant is always preserved: if
   A has selected B as its next hop, then D(B) &lt; D(A), which implies
   that the forwarding graph is loop-free.

   Babel uses a slightly more refined feasibility condition, derived
   from EIGRP [<a href="#ref-DUAL" title="&quot;Loop-free routing using diffusing computations&quot;">DUAL</a>].  Given a router A, define the feasibility distance
   of A, written FD(A), as the smallest metric that A has ever
   advertised for S to any of its neighbours.  An update sent by a
   neighbour B of A is feasible when the metric D(B) advertised by B is
   strictly smaller than A&#x27;s feasibility distance, i.e., when D(B) &lt;
   FD(A).

   It is easy to see that this latter condition is no more restrictive
   than DSDV-feasibility.  Suppose that node A obeys DSDV-feasibility;
   then D(A) is nonincreasing, hence at all times D(A) &lt;= FD(A).
   Suppose now that A receives a DSDV-feasible update that advertises a
   metric D(B).  Since the update is DSDV-feasible, C(A, B) + D(B) &lt;=
   D(A), hence D(B) &lt; D(A), and since D(A) &lt;= FD(A), D(B) &lt; FD(A).

   To see that it is strictly less restrictive, consider the following
   diagram, where A has selected the route through B, and D(A) = FD(A) =
   2.  Since D(C) = 1 &lt; FD(A), the alternate route through C is feasible
   for A, although its metric C(A, C) + D(C) = 5 is larger than that of
   the currently selected route:

      B
   1 / \ 1
    /   \
   S     A
    \   /
   1 \ / 4
      C

   To show that this feasibility condition still guarantees loop-
   freedom, recall that at the time when A accepts an update from B, the
   metric D(B) announced by B is no smaller than FD(B); since it is
   smaller than FD(A), at that point in time FD(B) &lt; FD(A).  Since this
   property is preserved when A sends updates and also when it picks a
   different next hop, it remains true at all times, which ensures that
   the forwarding graph has no loops.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.5" href="#section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Solving Starvation: Sequencing Routes</span>

   Obviously, the feasibility conditions defined above cause starvation
   when a router runs out of feasible routes.  Consider the following
   diagram, where both A and B have selected the direct route to S:

      A
   1 /|        D(A) = 1
    / |       FD(A) = 1
   S  |1
    \ |        D(B) = 2
   2 \|       FD(B) = 2
      B

   Suppose now that the link between A and S breaks:

      A
      |
      |       FD(A) = 1
   S  |1
    \ |        D(B) = 2
   2 \|       FD(B) = 2
      B

   The only route available from A to S, the one that goes through B, is
   not feasible: A suffers from spurious starvation.  At that point, the
   whole subtree suffering from starvation must be reset, which is
   essentially what EIGRP does when it performs a global synchronisation
   of all the routers in the starving subtree (the &quot;active&quot; phase of
   EIGRP).

   Babel reacts to starvation in a less drastic manner, by using
   sequenced routes, a technique introduced by DSDV and adopted by AODV.
   In addition to a metric, every route carries a sequence number, a
   nondecreasing integer that is propagated unchanged through the
   network and is only ever incremented by the source; a pair (s, m),
   where s is a sequence number and m a metric, is called a distance.

   A received update is feasible when either it is more recent than the
   feasibility distance maintained by the receiving node, or it is
   equally recent and the metric is strictly smaller.  More formally, if
   FD(A) = (s, m), then an update carrying the distance (s&#x27;, m&#x27;) is
   feasible when either s&#x27; &gt; s, or s = s&#x27; and m&#x27; &lt; m.

   Assuming the sequence number of S is 137, the diagram above becomes:

      A
      |
      |       FD(A) = (137, 1)
   S  |1
    \ |        D(B) = (137, 2)
   2 \|       FD(B) = (137, 2)
      B

   After S increases its sequence number, and the new sequence number is
   propagated to B, we have:

      A
      |
      |       FD(A) = (137, 1)
   S  |1
    \ |        D(B) = (138, 2)
   2 \|       FD(B) = (138, 2)
      B

   at which point the route through B becomes feasible again.

   Note that while sequence numbers are used for determining
   feasibility, they are not used in route selection: a node ignores the
   sequence number when selecting the best route to a given destination
   (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>).  Doing otherwise would cause route oscillation while a
   sequence number propagates through the network, and might even cause
   persistent black-holes with some exotic metrics.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.6" href="#section-2.6">2.6</a>.  Requests</span>

   In DSDV, the sequence number of a source is increased periodically.
   A route becomes feasible again after the source increases its
   sequence number, and the new sequence number is propagated through
   the network, which may, in general, require a significant amount of
   time.

   Babel takes a different approach.  When a node detects that it is
   suffering from a potentially spurious starvation, it sends an
   explicit request to the source for a new sequence number.  This
   request is forwarded hop by hop to the source, with no regard to the
   feasibility condition.  Upon receiving the request, the source
   increases its sequence number and broadcasts an update, which is
   forwarded to the requesting node.

   Note that after a change in network topology not all such requests
   will, in general, reach the source, as some will be sent over links
   that are now broken.  However, if the network is still connected,
   then at least one among the nodes suffering from spurious starvation
   has an (unfeasible) route to the source; hence, in the absence of
   packet loss, at least one such request will reach the source.
   (Resending requests a small number of times compensates for packet
   loss.)

   Since requests are forwarded with no regard to the feasibility
   condition, they may, in general, be caught in a forwarding loop; this
   is avoided by having nodes perform duplicate detection for the
   requests that they forward.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.7" href="#section-2.7">2.7</a>.  Multiple Routers</span>

   The above discussion assumes that each prefix is originated by a
   single router.  In real networks, however, it is often necessary to
   have a single prefix originated by multiple routers: for example, the
   default route will be originated by all of the edge routers of a
   routing domain.

   Since synchronising sequence numbers between distinct routers is
   problematic, Babel treats routes for the same prefix as distinct
   entities when they are originated by different routers: every route
   announcement carries the router-id of its originating router, and
   feasibility distances are not maintained per prefix, but per source,
   where a source is a pair of a router-id and a prefix.  In effect,
   Babel guarantees loop-freedom for the forwarding graph to every
   source; since the union of multiple acyclic graphs is not in general
   acyclic, Babel does not in general guarantee loop-freedom when a
   prefix is originated by multiple routers, but any loops will be
   broken in a time at most proportional to the diameter of the loop --
   as soon as an update has &quot;gone around&quot; the routing loop.

   Consider for example the following topology, where A has selected the
   default route through S, and B has selected the one through S&#x27;:

              1     1     1
   ::/0 -- S --- A --- B --- S&#x27; -- ::/0

   Suppose that both default routes fail at the same time; then nothing
   prevents A from switching to B, and B simultaneously switching to A.
   However, as soon as A has successfully advertised the new route to B,
   the route through A will become unfeasible for B.  Conversely, as
   soon as B will have advertised the route through A, the route through
   B will become unfeasible for A.

   In effect, the routing loop disappears at the latest when routing
   information has gone around the loop.  Since this process can be
   delayed by lost packets, Babel makes certain efforts to ensure that
   updates are sent reliably after a router-id change (<a href="#section-3.7.2">Section 3.7.2</a>).

   Additionally, after the routers have advertised the two routes, both
   sources will be in their source tables, which will prevent them from
   ever again participating in a routing loop involving routes from S
   and S&#x27; (up to the source GC time, which, available memory permitting,
   can be set to arbitrarily large values).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.8" href="#section-2.8">2.8</a>.  Overlapping Prefixes</span>

   In the above discussion, we have assumed that all prefixes are
   disjoint, as is the case in flat (&quot;mesh&quot;) routing.  In practice,
   however, prefixes may overlap: for example, the default route
   overlaps with all of the routes present in the network.

   After a route fails, it is not correct in general to switch to a
   route that subsumes the failed route.  Consider for example the
   following configuration:

              1     1
   ::/0 -- A --- B --- C

   Suppose that node C fails.  If B forwards packets destined to C by
   following the default route, a routing loop will form, and persist
   until A learns of B&#x27;s retraction of the direct route to C.  B avoids
   this pitfall by installing an &quot;unreachable&quot; route after a route is
   retracted; this route is maintained until it can be guaranteed that
   the former route has been retracted by all of B&#x27;s neighbours
   (<a href="#section-3.5.4">Section 3.5.4</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Protocol Operation</span>

   Every Babel speaker is assigned a router-id, which is an arbitrary
   string of 8 octets that is assumed unique across the routing domain.
   For example, router-ids could be assigned randomly, or they could be
   derived from a link-layer address.  (The protocol encoding is
   slightly more compact when router-ids are assigned in the same manner
   as the IPv6 layer assigns host IDs; see the definition of the &quot;R&quot;
   flag in <a href="#section-4.6.9">Section 4.6.9</a>.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Message Transmission and Reception</span>

   Babel protocol packets are sent in the body of a UDP datagram (as
   described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).  Each Babel packet consists of zero or more
   TLVs.  Most TLVs may contain sub-TLVs.

   Babel&#x27;s control traffic can be carried indifferently over IPv6 or
   over IPv4, and prefixes of either address family can be announced
   over either protocol.  Thus, there are at least two natural
   deployment models: using IPv6 exclusively for all control traffic, or
   running two distinct protocol instances, one for each address family.
   The exclusive use of IPv6 for all control traffic is RECOMMENDED,
   since using both protocols at the same time doubles the amount of
   traffic devoted to neighbour discovery and link quality estimation.

   The source address of a Babel packet is always a unicast address,
   link-local in the case of IPv6.  Babel packets may be sent to a well-
   known (link-local) multicast address or to a (link-local) unicast
   address.  In normal operation, a Babel speaker sends both multicast
   and unicast packets to its neighbours.

   With the exception of acknowledgments, all Babel TLVs can be sent to
   either unicast or multicast addresses, and their semantics does not
   depend on whether the destination is a unicast or a multicast
   address.  Hence, a Babel speaker does not need to determine the
   destination address of a packet that it receives in order to
   interpret it.

   A moderate amount of jitter may be applied to packets sent by a Babel
   speaker: outgoing TLVs are buffered and SHOULD be sent with a random
   delay.  This is done for two purposes: it avoids synchronisation of
   multiple Babel speakers across a network [<a href="#ref-JITTER" title="&quot;The Synchronization of Periodic Routing Messages&quot;">JITTER</a>], and it allows for
   the aggregation of multiple TLVs into a single packet.

   The maximum amount of delay a TLV can be subjected to depends on the
   TLV.  When the protocol description specifies that a TLV is urgent
   (as in <a href="#section-3.7.2">Section 3.7.2</a> and <a href="#section-3.8.1">Section 3.8.1</a>), then the TLV MUST be sent
   within a short time known as the urgent timeout (see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for
   recommended values).  When the TLV is governed by a timeout
   explicitly included in a previous TLV, such as in the case of
   Acknowledgments (<a href="#section-4.6.4">Section 4.6.4</a>), Updates (<a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>), and IHUs
   (<a href="#section-3.4.2">Section 3.4.2</a>), then the TLV MUST be sent early enough to meet the
   explicit deadline (with a small margin to allow for propagation
   delays).  In all other cases, the TLV SHOULD be sent out within one-
   half of the Multicast Hello interval.

   In order to avoid packet drops (either at the sender or at the
   receiver), a delay SHOULD be introduced between successive packets
   sent out on the same interface, within the constraints of the
   previous paragraph.  Note, however, that such packet pacing might
   impair the ability of some link layers (e.g., IEEE 802.11
   [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.11">IEEE802.11</a>]) to perform packet aggregation.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Data Structures</span>

   In this section, we describe the data structures that every Babel
   speaker maintains.  This description is conceptual: a Babel speaker
   may use different data structures as long as the resulting protocol
   is the same as the one described in this document.  For example,
   rather than maintaining a single table containing both selected and
   unselected (fallback) routes, as described in <a href="#section-3.2.6">Section 3.2.6</a>, an
   actual implementation would probably use two tables, one with
   selected routes and one with fallback routes.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.1" href="#section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Sequence Number Arithmetic</span>

   Sequence numbers (seqnos) appear in a number of Babel data
   structures, and they are interpreted as integers modulo 2^(16).  For
   the purposes of this document, arithmetic on sequence numbers is
   defined as follows.

   Given a seqno s and a non-negative integer n, the sum of s and n is
   defined by the following:

      s + n (modulo 2^(16)) = (s + n) MOD 2^(16)

   or, equivalently,

      s + n (modulo 2^(16)) = (s + n) AND 65535

   where MOD is the modulo operation yielding a non-negative integer,
   and AND is the bitwise conjunction operation.

   Given two sequence numbers s and s&#x27;, the relation s is less than s&#x27;
   (s &lt; s&#x27;) is defined by the following:

      s &lt; s&#x27; (modulo 2^(16)) when 0 &lt; ((s&#x27; - s) MOD 2^(16)) &lt; 32768

   or, equivalently,

      s &lt; s&#x27; (modulo 2^(16)) when s /= s&#x27; and ((s&#x27; - s) AND 32768) = 0.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.2" href="#section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  Node Sequence Number</span>

   A node&#x27;s sequence number is a 16-bit integer that is included in
   route updates sent for routes originated by this node.

   A node increments its sequence number (modulo 2^(16)) whenever it
   receives a request for a new sequence number (<a href="#section-3.8.1.2">Section 3.8.1.2</a>).  A
   node SHOULD NOT increment its sequence number (seqno) spontaneously,
   since increasing seqnos makes it less likely that other nodes will
   have feasible alternate routes when their selected routes fail.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.3" href="#section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>.  The Interface Table</span>

   The interface table contains the list of interfaces on which the node
   speaks the Babel protocol.  Every interface table entry contains the
   interface&#x27;s outgoing Multicast Hello seqno, a 16-bit integer that is
   sent with each Multicast Hello TLV on this interface and is
   incremented (modulo 2^(16)) whenever a Multicast Hello is sent.
   (Note that an interface&#x27;s Multicast Hello seqno is unrelated to the
   node&#x27;s seqno.)

   There are two timers associated with each interface table entry.  The
   periodic multicast hello timer governs the sending of scheduled
   Multicast Hello and IHU packets (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>).  The periodic Update
   timer governs the sending of periodic route updates (<a href="#section-3.7.1">Section 3.7.1</a>).
   See <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for suggested time constants.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.4" href="#section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  The Neighbour Table</span>

   The neighbour table contains the list of all neighbouring interfaces
   from which a Babel packet has been recently received.  The neighbour
   table is indexed by pairs of the form (interface, address), and every
   neighbour table entry contains the following data:

   *  the local node&#x27;s interface over which this neighbour is reachable;

   *  the address of the neighbouring interface;

   *  a history of recently received Multicast Hello packets from this
      neighbour; this can, for example, be a sequence of n bits, for
      some small value n, indicating which of the n hellos most recently
      sent by this neighbour have been received by the local node;

   *  a history of recently received Unicast Hello packets from this
      neighbour;

   *  the &quot;transmission cost&quot; value from the last IHU packet received
      from this neighbour, or FFFF hexadecimal (infinity) if the IHU
      hold timer for this neighbour has expired;

   *  the expected incoming Multicast Hello sequence number for this
      neighbour, an integer modulo 2^(16).

   *  the expected incoming Unicast Hello sequence number for this
      neighbour, an integer modulo 2^(16).

   *  the outgoing Unicast Hello sequence number for this neighbour, an
      integer modulo 2^(16) that is sent with each Unicast Hello TLV to
      this neighbour and is incremented (modulo 2^(16)) whenever a
      Unicast Hello is sent.  (Note that the outgoing Unicast Hello
      seqno for a neighbour is distinct from the interface&#x27;s outgoing
      Multicast Hello seqno.)

   There are three timers associated with each neighbour entry -- the
   multicast hello timer, which is set to the interval value carried by
   scheduled Multicast Hello TLVs sent by this neighbour, the unicast
   hello timer, which is set to the interval value carried by scheduled
   Unicast Hello TLVs, and the IHU timer, which is set to a small
   multiple of the interval carried in IHU TLVs (see &quot;IHU Hold time&quot; in
   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for suggested values).

   Note that the neighbour table is indexed by IP addresses, not by
   router-ids: neighbourship is a relationship between interfaces, not
   between nodes.  Therefore, two nodes with multiple interfaces can
   participate in multiple neighbourship relationships, a situation that
   can notably arise when wireless nodes with multiple radios are
   involved.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.5" href="#section-3.2.5">3.2.5</a>.  The Source Table</span>

   The source table is used to record feasibility distances.  It is
   indexed by triples of the form (prefix, plen, router-id), and every
   source table entry contains the following data:

   *  the prefix (prefix, plen), where plen is the prefix length in
      bits, that this entry applies to;

   *  the router-id of a router originating this prefix;

   *  a pair (seqno, metric), this source&#x27;s feasibility distance.

   There is one timer associated with each entry in the source table --
   the source garbage-collection timer.  It is initialised to a time on
   the order of minutes and reset as specified in <a href="#section-3.7.3">Section 3.7.3</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.6" href="#section-3.2.6">3.2.6</a>.  The Route Table</span>

   The route table contains the routes known to this node.  It is
   indexed by triples of the form (prefix, plen, neighbour), and every
   route table entry contains the following data:

   *  the source (prefix, plen, router-id) for which this route is
      advertised;

   *  the neighbour (an entry in the neighbour table) that advertised
      this route;

   *  the metric with which this route was advertised by the neighbour,
      or FFFF hexadecimal (infinity) for a recently retracted route;

   *  the sequence number with which this route was advertised;

   *  the next-hop address of this route;

   *  a boolean flag indicating whether this route is selected, i.e.,
      whether it is currently being used for forwarding and is being
      advertised.

   There is one timer associated with each route table entry -- the
   route expiry timer.  It is initialised and reset as specified in
   <a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a>.

   Note that there are two distinct (seqno, metric) pairs associated
   with each route: the route&#x27;s distance, which is stored in the route
   table, and the feasibility distance, which is stored in the source
   table and shared between all routes with the same source.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.7" href="#section-3.2.7">3.2.7</a>.  The Table of Pending Seqno Requests</span>

   The table of pending seqno requests contains a list of seqno requests
   that the local node has sent (either because they have been
   originated locally, or because they were forwarded) and to which no
   reply has been received yet.  This table is indexed by triples of the
   form (prefix, plen, router-id), and every entry in this table
   contains the following data:

   *  the prefix, plen, router-id, and seqno being requested;

   *  the neighbour, if any, on behalf of which we are forwarding this
      request;

   *  a small integer indicating the number of times that this request
      will be resent if it remains unsatisfied.

   There is one timer associated with each pending seqno request; it
   governs both the resending of requests and their expiry.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Acknowledgments and Acknowledgment Requests</span>

   A Babel speaker may request that a neighbour receiving a given packet
   reply with an explicit acknowledgment within a given time.  While the
   use of acknowledgment requests is optional, every Babel speaker MUST
   be able to reply to such a request.

   An acknowledgment MUST be sent to a unicast destination.  On the
   other hand, acknowledgment requests may be sent to either unicast or
   multicast destinations, in which case they request an acknowledgment
   from all of the receiving nodes.

   When to request acknowledgments is a matter of local policy; the
   simplest strategy is to never request acknowledgments and to rely on
   periodic updates to ensure that any reachable routes are eventually
   propagated throughout the routing domain.  In order to improve
   convergence speed and to reduce the amount of control traffic,
   acknowledgment requests MAY be used in order to reliably send urgent
   updates (<a href="#section-3.7.2">Section 3.7.2</a>) and retractions (<a href="#section-3.5.4">Section 3.5.4</a>), especially
   when the number of neighbours on a given interface is small.  Since
   Babel is designed to deal gracefully with packet loss on unreliable
   media, sending all packets with acknowledgment requests is not
   necessary and NOT RECOMMENDED, as the acknowledgments cause
   additional traffic and may force additional Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP) or Neighbour Discovery (ND) exchanges.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Neighbour Acquisition</span>

   Neighbour acquisition is the process by which a Babel node discovers
   the set of neighbours heard over each of its interfaces and
   ascertains bidirectional reachability.  On unreliable media,
   neighbour acquisition additionally provides some statistics that may
   be useful for link quality computation.

   Before it can exchange routing information with a neighbour, a Babel
   node MUST create an entry for that neighbour in the neighbour table.
   When to do that is implementation-specific; suitable strategies
   include creating an entry when any Babel packet is received, or
   creating an entry when a Hello TLV is parsed.  Similarly, in order to
   conserve system resources, an implementation SHOULD discard an entry
   when it has been unused for long enough; suitable strategies include
   dropping the neighbour after a timeout, and dropping a neighbour when
   the associated Hello histories become empty (see <a href="#appendix-A.2">Appendix A.2</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4.1" href="#section-3.4.1">3.4.1</a>.  Reverse Reachability Detection</span>

   Every Babel node sends Hello TLVs to its neighbours, at regular or
   irregular intervals, to indicate that it is alive.  Each Hello TLV
   carries an increasing (modulo 2^(16)) sequence number and an upper
   bound on the time interval until the next Hello of the same type (see
   below).  If the time interval is set to 0, then the Hello TLV does
   not establish a new promise: the deadline carried by the previous
   Hello of the same type still applies to the next Hello (if the most
   recent scheduled Hello of the right kind was received at time t0 and
   carried interval i, then the previous promise of sending another
   Hello before time t0 + i still holds).  We say that a Hello is
   &quot;scheduled&quot; if it carries a nonzero interval, and &quot;unscheduled&quot;
   otherwise.

   There are two kinds of Hellos: Multicast Hellos, which use a per-
   interface Hello counter (the Multicast Hello seqno), and Unicast
   Hellos, which use a per-neighbour counter (the Unicast Hello seqno).
   A Multicast Hello with a given seqno MUST be sent to all neighbours
   on a given interface, either by sending it to a multicast address or
   by sending it to one unicast address per neighbour (hence, the term
   &quot;Multicast Hello&quot; is a slight misnomer).  A Unicast Hello carrying a
   given seqno should normally be sent to just one neighbour (over
   unicast), since the sequence numbers of different neighbours are not
   in general synchronised.

   Multicast Hellos sent over multicast can be used for neighbour
   discovery; hence, a node SHOULD send periodic (scheduled) Multicast
   Hellos unless neighbour discovery is performed by means outside of
   the Babel protocol.  A node MAY send Unicast Hellos or unscheduled
   Hellos of either kind for any reason, such as reducing the amount of
   multicast traffic or improving reliability on link technologies with
   poor support for link-layer multicast.

   A node MAY send a scheduled Hello ahead of time.  A node MAY change
   its scheduled Hello interval.  The Hello interval MAY be decreased at
   any time; it MAY be increased immediately before sending a Hello TLV,
   but SHOULD NOT be increased at other times.  (Equivalently, a node
   SHOULD send a scheduled Hello immediately after increasing its Hello
   interval.)

   How to deal with received Hello TLVs and what statistics to maintain
   are considered local implementation matters; typically, a node will
   maintain some sort of history of recently received Hellos.  An
   example of a suitable algorithm is described in <a href="#appendix-A.1">Appendix A.1</a>.

   After receiving a Hello, or determining that it has missed one, the
   node recomputes the association&#x27;s cost (<a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>) and runs the
   route selection procedure (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4.2" href="#section-3.4.2">3.4.2</a>.  Bidirectional Reachability Detection</span>

   In order to establish bidirectional reachability, every node sends
   periodic IHU (&quot;I Heard You&quot;) TLVs to each of its neighbours.  Since
   IHUs carry an explicit interval value, they MAY be sent less often
   than Hellos in order to reduce the amount of routing traffic in dense
   networks; in particular, they SHOULD be sent less often than Hellos
   over links with little packet loss.  While IHUs are conceptually
   unicast, they MAY be sent to a multicast address in order to avoid an
   ARP or Neighbour Discovery exchange and to aggregate multiple IHUs
   into a single packet.

   In addition to the periodic IHUs, a node MAY, at any time, send an
   unscheduled IHU packet.  It MAY also, at any time, decrease its IHU
   interval, and it MAY increase its IHU interval immediately before
   sending an IHU, but SHOULD NOT increase it at any other time.
   (Equivalently, a node SHOULD send an extra IHU immediately after
   increasing its Hello interval.)

   Every IHU TLV contains two pieces of data: the link&#x27;s rxcost
   (reception cost) from the sender&#x27;s perspective, used by the neighbour
   for computing link costs (<a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>), and the interval between
   periodic IHU packets.  A node receiving an IHU sets the value of the
   txcost (transmission cost) maintained in the neighbour table to the
   value contained in the IHU, and resets the IHU timer associated to
   this neighbour to a small multiple of the interval value received in
   the IHU (see &quot;IHU Hold time&quot; in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for suggested values).
   When a neighbour&#x27;s IHU timer expires, the neighbour&#x27;s txcost is set
   to infinity.

   After updating a neighbour&#x27;s txcost, the receiving node recomputes
   the neighbour&#x27;s cost (<a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>) and runs the route selection
   procedure (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4.3" href="#section-3.4.3">3.4.3</a>.  Cost Computation</span>

   A neighbourship association&#x27;s link cost is computed from the values
   maintained in the neighbour table: the statistics kept in the
   neighbour table about the reception of Hellos, and the txcost
   computed from received IHU packets.

   For every neighbour, a Babel node computes a value known as this
   neighbour&#x27;s rxcost.  This value is usually derived from the Hello
   history, which may be combined with other data, such as statistics
   maintained by the link layer.  The rxcost is sent to a neighbour in
   each IHU.

   Since nodes do not necessarily send periodic Unicast Hellos but do
   usually send periodic Multicast Hellos (<a href="#section-3.4.1">Section 3.4.1</a>), a node SHOULD
   use an algorithm that yields a finite rxcost when only Multicast
   Hellos are received, unless interoperability with nodes that only
   send Multicast Hellos is not required.

   How the txcost and rxcost are combined in order to compute a link&#x27;s
   cost is a matter of local policy; as far as Babel&#x27;s correctness is
   concerned, only the following conditions MUST be satisfied:

   *  the cost is strictly positive;

   *  if no Hello TLVs of either kind were received recently, then the
      cost is infinite;

   *  if the txcost is infinite, then the cost is infinite.

   See <a href="#appendix-A.2">Appendix A.2</a> for RECOMMENDED strategies for computing a link&#x27;s
   cost.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Routing Table Maintenance</span>

   Conceptually, a Babel update is a quintuple (prefix, plen, router-id,
   seqno, metric), where (prefix, plen) is the prefix for which a route
   is being advertised, router-id is the router-id of the router
   originating this update, seqno is a nondecreasing (modulo 2^(16))
   integer that carries the originating router seqno, and metric is the
   announced metric.

   Before being accepted, an update is checked against the feasibility
   condition (<a href="#section-3.5.1">Section 3.5.1</a>), which ensures that the route does not
   create a routing loop.  If the feasibility condition is not
   satisfied, the update is either ignored or prevents the route from
   being selected, as described in <a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a>.  If the feasibility
   condition is satisfied, then the update cannot possibly cause a
   routing loop.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.1" href="#section-3.5.1">3.5.1</a>.  The Feasibility Condition</span>

   The feasibility condition is applied to all received updates.  The
   feasibility condition compares the metric in the received update with
   the metrics of the updates previously sent by the receiving node;
   updates that fail the feasibility condition, and therefore have
   metrics large enough to cause a routing loop, are either ignored or
   prevent the resulting route from being selected.

   A feasibility distance is a pair (seqno, metric), where seqno is an
   integer modulo 2^(16) and metric is a positive integer.  Feasibility
   distances are compared lexicographically, with the first component
   inverted: we say that a distance (seqno, metric) is strictly better
   than a distance (seqno&#x27;, metric&#x27;), written

      (seqno, metric) &lt; (seqno&#x27;, metric&#x27;)

   when

      seqno &gt; seqno&#x27; or (seqno = seqno&#x27; and metric &lt; metric&#x27;)

   where sequence numbers are compared modulo 2^(16).

   Given a source (prefix, plen, router-id), a node&#x27;s feasibility
   distance for this source is the minimum, according to the ordering
   defined above, of the distances of all the finite updates ever sent
   by this particular node for the prefix (prefix, plen) and the given
   router-id.  Feasibility distances are maintained in the source table,
   the exact procedure is given in <a href="#section-3.7.3">Section 3.7.3</a>.

   A received update is feasible when either it is a retraction (its
   metric is FFFF hexadecimal), or the advertised distance is strictly
   better, in the sense defined above, than the feasibility distance for
   the corresponding source.  More precisely, a route advertisement
   carrying the quintuple (prefix, plen, router-id, seqno, metric) is
   feasible if one of the following conditions holds:

   *  metric is infinite; or

   *  no entry exists in the source table indexed by (prefix, plen,
      router-id); or

   *  an entry (prefix, plen, router-id, seqno&#x27;, metric&#x27;) exists in the
      source table, and either

      -  seqno&#x27; &lt; seqno or

      -  seqno = seqno&#x27; and metric &lt; metric&#x27;.

   Note that the feasibility condition considers the metric advertised
   by the neighbour, not the route&#x27;s metric; hence, a fluctuation in a
   neighbour&#x27;s cost cannot render a selected route unfeasible.  Note
   further that retractions (updates with infinite metric) are always
   feasible, since they cannot possibly cause a routing loop.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.2" href="#section-3.5.2">3.5.2</a>.  Metric Computation</span>

   A route&#x27;s metric is computed from the metric advertised by the
   neighbour and the neighbour&#x27;s link cost.  Just like cost computation,
   metric computation is considered a local policy matter; as far as
   Babel is concerned, the function M(c, m) used for computing a metric
   from a locally computed link cost c and the metric m advertised by a
   neighbour MUST only satisfy the following conditions:

   *  if c is infinite, then M(c, m) is infinite;

   *  M is strictly monotonic: M(c, m) &gt; m.

   Additionally, the metric SHOULD satisfy the following condition:

   *  M is left-distributive: if m &lt;= m&#x27;, then M(c, m) &lt;= M(c, m&#x27;).

   While strict monotonicity is essential to the integrity of the
   network (persistent routing loops may arise if it is not satisfied),
   left-distributivity is not: if it is not satisfied, Babel will still
   converge to a loop-free configuration, but might not reach a global
   optimum (in fact, a global optimum may not even exist).

   The conditions above are easily satisfied by using the additive
   metric, i.e., by defining M(c, m) = c + m.  Since the additive metric
   is useful with a large range of cost computation strategies, it is
   the RECOMMENDED default.  See also <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>, which describes a
   technique that makes it possible to tweak the values of individual
   metrics without running the risk of creating routing loops.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.3" href="#section-3.5.3">3.5.3</a>.  Route Acquisition</span>

   When a Babel node receives an update (prefix, plen, router-id, seqno,
   metric) from a neighbour neigh, it checks whether it already has a
   route table entry indexed by (prefix, plen, neigh).

   If no such entry exists:

   *  if the update is unfeasible, it MAY be ignored;

   *  if the metric is infinite (the update is a retraction of a route
      we do not know about), the update is ignored;

   *  otherwise, a new entry is created in the route table, indexed by
      (prefix, plen, neigh), with source equal to (prefix, plen, router-
      id), seqno equal to seqno, and an advertised metric equal to the
      metric carried by the update.

   If such an entry exists:

   *  if the entry is currently selected, the update is unfeasible, and
      the router-id of the update is equal to the router-id of the
      entry, then the update MAY be ignored;

   *  otherwise, the entry&#x27;s sequence number, advertised metric, metric,
      and router-id are updated, and if the advertised metric is not
      infinite, the route&#x27;s expiry timer is reset to a small multiple of
      the interval value included in the update (see &quot;Route Expiry time&quot;
      in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for suggested values).  If the update is unfeasible,
      then the (now unfeasible) entry MUST be immediately unselected.
      If the update caused the router-id of the entry to change, an
      update (possibly a retraction) MUST be sent in a timely manner as
      described in <a href="#section-3.7.2">Section 3.7.2</a>.

   Note that the route table may contain unfeasible routes, either
   because they were created by an unfeasible update or due to a metric
   fluctuation.  Such routes are never selected, since they are not
   known to be loop-free.  Should all the feasible routes become
   unusable, however, the unfeasible routes can be made feasible and
   therefore possible to select by sending requests along them (see
   <a href="#section-3.8.2">Section 3.8.2</a>).

   When a route&#x27;s expiry timer triggers, the behaviour depends on
   whether the route&#x27;s metric is finite.  If the metric is finite, it is
   set to infinity and the expiry timer is reset.  If the metric is
   already infinite, the route is flushed from the route table.

   After the route table is updated, the route selection procedure
   (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>) is run.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.4" href="#section-3.5.4">3.5.4</a>.  Hold Time</span>

   When a prefix P is retracted (because all routes are unfeasible or
   have an infinite metric, whether due to the expiry timer or for other
   reasons), and a shorter prefix P&#x27; that covers P is reachable, P&#x27;
   cannot in general be used for routing packets destined to P without
   running the risk of creating a routing loop (<a href="#section-2.8">Section 2.8</a>).

   To avoid this issue, whenever a prefix P is retracted, a route table
   entry with infinite metric is maintained as described in
   <a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a>.  As long as this entry is maintained, packets destined
   to an address within P MUST NOT be forwarded by following a route for
   a shorter prefix.  This entry is removed as soon as a finite-metric
   update for prefix P is received and the resulting route selected.  If
   no such update is forthcoming, the infinite metric entry SHOULD be
   maintained at least until it is guaranteed that no neighbour has
   selected the current node as next hop for prefix P.  This can be
   achieved by either:

   *  waiting until the route&#x27;s expiry timer has expired
      (<a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a>); or

   *  sending a retraction with an acknowledgment request (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>)
      to every reachable neighbour that has not explicitly retracted
      prefix P, and waiting for all acknowledgments.

   The former option is simpler and ensures that, at that point, any
   routes for prefix P pointing at the current node have expired.
   However, since the expiry time can be as high as a few minutes, doing
   that prevents automatic aggregation by creating spurious black-holes
   for aggregated routes.  The latter option is RECOMMENDED as it
   dramatically reduces the time for which a prefix is unreachable in
   the presence of aggregated routes.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.6" href="#section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Route Selection</span>

   Route selection is the process by which a single route for a given
   prefix is selected to be used for forwarding packets and to be re-
   advertised to a node&#x27;s neighbours.

   Babel is designed to allow flexible route selection policies.  As far
   as the algorithm&#x27;s correctness is concerned, the route selection
   policy MUST only satisfy the following properties:

   *  a route with infinite metric (a retracted route) is never
      selected;

   *  an unfeasible route is never selected.

   Babel nodes using different route selection strategies will
   interoperate and will not create routing loops as long as these two
   properties hold.

   Route selection MUST NOT take seqnos into account: a route MUST NOT
   be preferred just because it carries a higher (more recent) seqno.
   Doing otherwise would cause route oscillation while a new seqno
   propagates across the network, and might create persistent black-
   holes if the metric being used is not left-distributive
   (<a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>).

   The obvious route selection strategy is to pick, for every
   destination, the feasible route with minimal metric.  When all
   metrics are stable, this approach ensures convergence to a tree of
   shortest paths (assuming that the metric is left-distributive, see
   <a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>).  There are two reasons, however, why this strategy
   may lead to instability in the presence of continuously varying
   metrics.  First, if two parallel routes oscillate around a common
   value, then the smallest metric strategy will keep switching between
   the two.  Second, the selection of a route increases congestion along
   it, which might increase packet loss, which in turn could cause its
   metric to increase; this kind of feedback loop is prone to causing
   persistent oscillations.

   In order to limit these kinds of instabilities, a route selection
   strategy SHOULD include some form of hysteresis, i.e., be sensitive
   to a route&#x27;s history: the strategy should only switch from the
   currently selected route to a different route if the latter has been
   consistently good for some period of time.  A RECOMMENDED hysteresis
   algorithm is given in <a href="#appendix-A.3">Appendix A.3</a>.

   After the route selection procedure is run, triggered updates
   (<a href="#section-3.7.2">Section 3.7.2</a>) and requests (<a href="#section-3.8.2">Section 3.8.2</a>) are sent.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.7" href="#section-3.7">3.7</a>.  Sending Updates</span>

   A Babel speaker advertises to its neighbours its set of selected
   routes.  Normally, this is done by sending one or more multicast
   packets containing Update TLVs on all of its connected interfaces;
   however, on link technologies where multicast is significantly more
   expensive than unicast, a node MAY choose to send multiple copies of
   updates in unicast packets, especially when the number of neighbours
   is small.

   Additionally, in order to ensure that any black-holes are reliably
   cleared in a timely manner, a Babel node may send retractions
   (updates with an infinite metric) for any recently retracted
   prefixes.

   If an update is for a route injected into the Babel domain by the
   local node (e.g., it carries the address of a local interface, the
   prefix of a directly attached network, or a prefix redistributed from
   a different routing protocol), the router-id is set to the local
   node&#x27;s router-id, the metric is set to some arbitrary finite value
   (typically 0), and the seqno is set to the local router&#x27;s sequence
   number.

   If an update is for a route learnt from another Babel speaker, the
   router-id and sequence number are copied from the route table entry,
   and the metric is computed as specified in <a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.7.1" href="#section-3.7.1">3.7.1</a>.  Periodic Updates</span>

   Every Babel speaker MUST advertise each of its selected routes on
   every interface, at least once every Update interval.  Since Babel
   doesn&#x27;t suffer from routing loops (there is no &quot;counting to
   infinity&quot;) and relies heavily on triggered updates (<a href="#section-3.7.2">Section 3.7.2</a>),
   this full dump only needs to happen infrequently (see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for
   suggested intervals).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.7.2" href="#section-3.7.2">3.7.2</a>.  Triggered Updates</span>

   In addition to periodic routing updates, a Babel speaker sends
   unscheduled, or triggered, updates in order to inform its neighbours
   of a significant change in the network topology.

   A change of router-id for the selected route to a given prefix may be
   indicative of a routing loop in formation; hence, whenever it changes
   the selected router-id for a given destination, a node MUST send an
   update as an urgent TLV (as defined in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).  Additionally,
   it SHOULD make a reasonable attempt at ensuring that all reachable
   neighbours receive this update.

   There are two strategies for ensuring that.  If the number of
   neighbours is small, then it is reasonable to send the update
   together with an acknowledgment request; the update is resent until
   all neighbours have acknowledged the packet, up to some number of
   times.  If the number of neighbours is large, however, requesting
   acknowledgments from all of them might cause a non-negligible amount
   of network traffic; in that case, it may be preferable to simply
   repeat the update some reasonable number of times (say, 3 for
   wireless and 2 for wired links).  The number of copies MUST NOT
   exceed 5, and the copies SHOULD be separated by a small delay, as
   described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

   A route retraction is somewhat less worrying: if the route retraction
   doesn&#x27;t reach all neighbours, a black-hole might be created, which,
   unlike a routing loop, does not endanger the integrity of the
   network.  When a route is retracted, a node SHOULD send a triggered
   update and SHOULD make a reasonable attempt at ensuring that all
   neighbours receive this retraction.

   Finally, a node MAY send a triggered update when the metric for a
   given prefix changes in a significant manner, due to a received
   update, because a link&#x27;s cost has changed or because a different next
   hop has been selected.  A node SHOULD NOT send triggered updates for
   other reasons, such as when there is a minor fluctuation in a route&#x27;s
   metric, when the selected next hop changes without inducing a
   significant change to the route&#x27;s metric, or to propagate a new
   sequence number (except to satisfy a request, as specified in
   <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.7.3" href="#section-3.7.3">3.7.3</a>.  Maintaining Feasibility Distances</span>

   Before sending an update (prefix, plen, router-id, seqno, metric)
   with finite metric (i.e., not a route retraction), a Babel node
   updates the feasibility distance maintained in the source table.
   This is done as follows.

   If no entry indexed by (prefix, plen, router-id) exists in the source
   table, then one is created with value (prefix, plen, router-id,
   seqno, metric).

   If an entry (prefix, plen, router-id, seqno&#x27;, metric&#x27;) exists, then
   it is updated as follows:

   *  if seqno &gt; seqno&#x27;, then seqno&#x27; := seqno, metric&#x27; := metric;

   *  if seqno = seqno&#x27; and metric&#x27; &gt; metric, then metric&#x27; := metric;

   *  otherwise, nothing needs to be done.

   The garbage-collection timer for the entry is then reset.  Note that
   the feasibility distance is not updated and the garbage-collection
   timer is not reset when a retraction (an update with infinite metric)
   is sent.

   When the garbage-collection timer expires, the entry is removed from
   the source table.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.7.4" href="#section-3.7.4">3.7.4</a>.  Split Horizon</span>

   When running over a transitive, symmetric link technology, e.g., a
   point-to-point link or a wired LAN technology such as Ethernet, a
   Babel node SHOULD use an optimisation known as split horizon.  When
   split horizon is used on a given interface, a routing update for
   prefix P is not sent on the particular interface over which the
   selected route towards prefix P was learnt.

   Split horizon SHOULD NOT be applied to an interface unless the
   interface is known to be symmetric and transitive; in particular,
   split horizon is not applicable to decentralised wireless link
   technologies (e.g., IEEE 802.11 in ad hoc mode) when routing updates
   are sent over multicast.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8" href="#section-3.8">3.8</a>.  Explicit Requests</span>

   In normal operation, a node&#x27;s route table is populated by the regular
   and triggered updates sent by its neighbours.  Under some
   circumstances, however, a node sends explicit requests in order to
   cause a resynchronisation with the source after a mobility event or
   to prevent a route from spuriously expiring.

   The Babel protocol provides two kinds of explicit requests: route
   requests, which simply request an update for a given prefix, and
   seqno requests, which request an update for a given prefix with a
   specific sequence number.  The former are never forwarded; the latter
   are forwarded if they cannot be satisfied by the receiver.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.1" href="#section-3.8.1">3.8.1</a>.  Handling Requests</span>

   Upon receiving a request, a node either forwards the request or sends
   an update in reply to the request, as described in the following
   sections.  If this causes an update to be sent, the update is either
   sent to a multicast address on the interface on which the request was
   received, or to the unicast address of the neighbour that sent the
   request.

   The exact behaviour is different for route requests and seqno
   requests.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.1.1" href="#section-3.8.1.1">3.8.1.1</a>.  Route Requests</span>

   When a node receives a route request for a given prefix, it checks
   its route table for a selected route to this exact prefix.  If such a
   route exists, it MUST send an update (over unicast or over
   multicast); if such a route does not exist, it MUST send a retraction
   for that prefix.

   When a node receives a wildcard route request, it SHOULD send a full
   route table dump.  Full route dumps SHOULD be rate-limited,
   especially if they are sent over multicast.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.1.2" href="#section-3.8.1.2">3.8.1.2</a>.  Seqno Requests</span>

   When a node receives a seqno request for a given router-id and
   sequence number, it checks whether its route table contains a
   selected entry for that prefix.  If a selected route for the given
   prefix exists and has finite metric, and either the router-ids are
   different or the router-ids are equal and the entry&#x27;s sequence number
   is no smaller (modulo 2^(16)) than the requested sequence number, the
   node MUST send an update for the given prefix.  If the router-ids
   match, but the requested seqno is larger (modulo 2^(16)) than the
   route entry&#x27;s, the node compares the router-id against its own
   router-id.  If the router-id is its own, then it increases its
   sequence number by 1 (modulo 2^(16)) and sends an update.  A node
   MUST NOT increase its sequence number by more than 1 in reaction to a
   single seqno request.

   Otherwise, if the requested router-id is not its own, the received
   node consults the Hop Count field of the request.  If the hop count
   is 2 or more, and the node is advertising the prefix to its
   neighbours, the node selects a neighbour to forward the request to as
   follows:

   *  if the node has one or more feasible routes towards the requested
      prefix with a next hop that is not the requesting node, then the
      node MUST forward the request to the next hop of one such route;

   *  otherwise, if the node has one or more (not feasible) routes to
      the requested prefix with a next hop that is not the requesting
      node, then the node SHOULD forward the request to the next hop of
      one such route.

   In order to actually forward the request, the node decrements the hop
   count and sends the request in a unicast packet destined to the
   selected neighbour.  The forwarded request SHOULD be sent as an
   urgent TLV (as defined in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).

   A node SHOULD maintain a list of recently forwarded seqno requests
   and forward the reply (an update with a seqno sufficiently large to
   satisfy the request) as an urgent TLV (as defined in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).  A
   node SHOULD compare every incoming seqno request against its list of
   recently forwarded seqno requests and avoid forwarding the request if
   it is redundant (i.e., if the node has recently sent a request with
   the same prefix, router-id, and a seqno that is not smaller modulo
   2^(16)).

   Since the request-forwarding mechanism does not necessarily obey the
   feasibility condition, it may get caught in routing loops; hence,
   requests carry a hop count to limit the time during which they remain
   in the network.  However, since requests are only ever forwarded as
   unicast packets, the initial hop count need not be kept particularly
   low, and performing an expanding horizon search is not necessary.  A
   single request MUST NOT be duplicated: it MUST NOT be forwarded to a
   multicast address, and it MUST NOT be forwarded to multiple
   neighbours.  However, if a seqno request is resent by its originator,
   the subsequent copies may be forwarded to a different neighbour than
   the initial one.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.2" href="#section-3.8.2">3.8.2</a>.  Sending Requests</span>

   A Babel node MAY send a route or seqno request at any time to a
   multicast or a unicast address; there is only one case when
   originating requests is required (<a href="#section-3.8.2.1">Section 3.8.2.1</a>).

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.2.1" href="#section-3.8.2.1">3.8.2.1</a>.  Avoiding Starvation</span>

   When a route is retracted or expires, a Babel node usually switches
   to another feasible route for the same prefix.  It may be the case,
   however, that no such routes are available.

   A node that has lost all feasible routes to a given destination but
   still has unexpired unfeasible routes to that destination MUST send a
   seqno request; if it doesn&#x27;t have any such routes, it MAY still send
   a seqno request.  The router-id of the request is set to the router-
   id of the route that it has just lost, and the requested seqno is the
   value contained in the source table plus 1.  The request carries a
   hop count, which is used as a last-resort mechanism to ensure that it
   eventually vanishes from the network; it MAY be set to any value that
   is larger than the diameter of the network (64 is a suitable default
   value).

   If the node has any (unfeasible) routes to the requested destination,
   then it MUST send the request to at least one of the next-hop
   neighbours that advertised these routes, and SHOULD send it to all of
   them; in any case, it MAY send the request to any other neighbours,
   whether they advertise a route to the requested destination or not.
   A simple implementation strategy is therefore to unconditionally
   multicast the request over all interfaces.

   Similar requests will be sent by other nodes that are affected by the
   route&#x27;s loss.  If the network is still connected, and assuming no
   packet loss, then at least one of these requests will be forwarded to
   the source, resulting in a route being advertised with a new sequence
   number.  (Due to duplicate suppression, only a small number of such
   requests are expected to actually reach the source.)

   In order to compensate for packet loss, a node SHOULD repeat such a
   request a small number of times if no route becomes feasible within a
   short time (see &quot;Request timeout&quot; in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for suggested
   values).  In the presence of heavy packet loss, however, all such
   requests might be lost; in that case, the mechanism in the next
   section will eventually ensure that a new seqno is received.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.2.2" href="#section-3.8.2.2">3.8.2.2</a>.  Dealing with Unfeasible Updates</span>

   When a route&#x27;s metric increases, a node might receive an unfeasible
   update for a route that it has currently selected.  As specified in
   <a href="#section-3.5.1">Section 3.5.1</a>, the receiving node will either ignore the update or
   unselect the route.

   In order to keep routes from spuriously expiring because they have
   become unfeasible, a node SHOULD send a unicast seqno request when it
   receives an unfeasible update for a route that is currently selected.
   The requested sequence number is computed from the source table as in
   <a href="#section-3.8.2.1">Section 3.8.2.1</a>.

   Additionally, since metric computation does not necessarily coincide
   with the delay in propagating updates, a node might receive an
   unfeasible update from a currently unselected neighbour that is
   preferable to the currently selected route (e.g., because it has a
   much smaller metric); in that case, the node SHOULD send a unicast
   seqno request to the neighbour that advertised the preferable update.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.2.3" href="#section-3.8.2.3">3.8.2.3</a>.  Preventing Routes from Expiring</span>

   In normal operation, a route&#x27;s expiry timer never triggers: since a
   route&#x27;s hold time is computed from an explicit interval included in
   Update TLVs, a new update (possibly a retraction) should arrive in
   time to prevent a route from expiring.

   In the presence of packet loss, however, it may be the case that no
   update is successfully received for an extended period of time,
   causing a route to expire.  In order to avoid such spurious expiry,
   shortly before a selected route expires, a Babel node SHOULD send a
   unicast route request to the neighbour that advertised this route;
   since nodes always send either updates or retractions in response to
   non-wildcard route requests (<a href="#section-3.8.1.1">Section 3.8.1.1</a>), this will usually
   result in the route being either refreshed or retracted.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Protocol Encoding</span>

   A Babel packet MUST be sent as the body of a UDP datagram, with
   network-layer hop count set to 1, destined to a well-known multicast
   address or to a unicast address, over IPv4 or IPv6; in the case of
   IPv6, these addresses are link-local.  Both the source and
   destination UDP port are set to a well-known port number.  A Babel
   packet MUST be silently ignored unless its source address is either a
   link-local IPv6 address or an IPv4 address belonging to the local
   network, and its source port is the well-known Babel port.  It MAY be
   silently ignored if its destination address is a global IPv6 address.

   In order to minimise the number of packets being sent while avoiding
   lower-layer fragmentation, a Babel node SHOULD maximise the size of
   the packets it sends, up to the outgoing interface&#x27;s MTU adjusted for
   lower-layer headers (28 octets for UDP over IPv4, 48 octets for UDP
   over IPv6).  It MUST NOT send packets larger than the attached
   interface&#x27;s MTU adjusted for lower-layer headers or 512 octets,
   whichever is larger, but not exceeding 2^(16) - 1 adjusted for lower-
   layer headers.  Every Babel speaker MUST be able to receive packets
   that are as large as any attached interface&#x27;s MTU adjusted for lower-
   layer headers or 512 octets, whichever is larger.  Babel packets MUST
   NOT be sent in IPv6 jumbograms [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2675" title="&quot;IPv6 Jumbograms&quot;">RFC2675</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Data Types</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Representation of Integers</span>

   All multi-octet fields that represent integers are encoded with the
   most significant octet first (in Big-Endian format [<a href="#ref-IEN137" title="&quot;On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace&quot;">IEN137</a>], also
   called network order).  The base protocol only carries unsigned
   values; if an extension needs to carry signed values, it will need to
   specify their encoding (e.g., two&#x27;s complement).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.2" href="#section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  Interval</span>

   Relative times are carried as 16-bit values specifying a number of
   centiseconds (hundredths of a second).  This allows times up to
   roughly 11 minutes with a granularity of 10 ms, which should cover
   all reasonable applications of Babel (see also <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.3" href="#section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a>.  Router-Id</span>

   A router-id is an arbitrary 8-octet value.  A router-id MUST NOT
   consist of either all binary zeroes (0000000000000000 hexadecimal) or
   all binary ones (FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF hexadecimal).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.4" href="#section-4.1.4">4.1.4</a>.  Address</span>

   Since the bulk of the protocol is taken by addresses, multiple ways
   of encoding addresses are defined.  Additionally, within Update TLVs
   a common subnet prefix may be omitted when multiple addresses are
   sent in a single packet -- this is known as address compression
   (<a href="#section-4.6.9">Section 4.6.9</a>).

   Address encodings (AEs):

   AE 0:     Wildcard address.  The value is 0 octets long.

   AE 1:     IPv4 address.  Compression is allowed.  4 octets or less.

   AE 2:     IPv6 address.  Compression is allowed.  16 octets or less.

   AE 3:     Link-local IPv6 address.  Compression is not allowed.  The
             value is 8 octets long, a prefix of fe80::/64 is implied.

   The address family associated with an address encoding is either IPv4
   or IPv6: it is undefined for AE 0, IPv4 for AE 1, and IPv6 for AEs 2
   and 3.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.5" href="#section-4.1.5">4.1.5</a>.  Prefixes</span>

   A network prefix is encoded just like a network address, but it is
   stored in the smallest number of octets that are enough to hold the
   significant bits (up to the prefix length).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Packet Format</span>

   A Babel packet consists of a 4-octet header, followed by a sequence
   of TLVs (the packet body), optionally followed by a second sequence
   of TLVs (the packet trailer).  The format is designed to be
   extensible; see <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a> for extensibility considerations.

             header (excluding the Magic, Version, and Body length
             fields, and excluding the packet trailer).

   Packet Body  The packet body; a sequence of TLVs.

   Packet Trailer  The packet trailer; another sequence of TLVs.

   The packet body and trailer are both sequences of TLVs.  The packet
   body is the normal place to store TLVs; the packet trailer only
   contains specialised TLVs that do not need to be protected by
   cryptographic security mechanisms.  When parsing the trailer, the
   receiver MUST ignore any TLV unless its definition explicitly states
   that it is allowed to appear there.  Among the TLVs defined in this
   document, only Pad1 and PadN are allowed in the trailer; since these
   TLVs are ignored in any case, an implementation MAY silently ignore
   the packet trailer without even parsing it, unless it implements at
   least one protocol extension that defines TLVs that are allowed to
   appear in the trailer.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  TLV Format</span>

   With the exception of Pad1, all TLVs have the following structure:

   Fields:

   Type      The type of the TLV.

   Length    The length of the body in octets, exclusive of the Type and
             Length fields.

   Payload   The TLV payload, which consists of a body and, for selected
             TLV types, an optional list of sub-TLVs.

   TLVs with an unknown type value MUST be silently ignored.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Sub-TLV Format</span>

   Every TLV carries an explicit length in its header; however, most
   TLVs are self-terminating, in the sense that it is possible to
   determine the length of the body without reference to the explicit
   Length field.  If a TLV has a self-terminating format, then the space
   between the natural size of the TLV and the size announced in the
   Length field may be used to store a sequence of sub-TLVs.

   Sub-TLVs have the same structure as TLVs.  With the exception of
   Pad1, all TLVs have the following structure:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   Fields:

   Type      The type of the sub-TLV.

   Length    The length of the body in octets, exclusive of the Type and
             Length fields.

   Body      The sub-TLV body, the interpretation of which depends on
             both the type of the sub-TLV and the type of the TLV within
             which it is embedded.

   The most significant bit of the sub-TLV type (the bit with value 80
   hexadecimal), is called the mandatory bit; in other words, sub-TLV
   types 128 through 255 have the mandatory bit set.  This bit indicates
   how to handle unknown sub-TLVs.  If the mandatory bit is not set,
   then an unknown sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored, and the rest of the
   TLV is processed normally.  If the mandatory bit is set, then the
   whole enclosing TLV MUST be silently ignored (except for updating the
   parser state by a Router-Id, Next Hop, or Update TLV, as described in
   the next section).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Parser State and Encoding of Updates</span>

   In a large network, the bulk of Babel traffic consists of route
   updates; hence, some care has been given to encoding them
   efficiently.  The data conceptually contained in an update
   (<a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>) is split into three pieces:

   *  the prefix, seqno, and metric are contained in the Update TLV
      itself (<a href="#section-4.6.9">Section 4.6.9</a>);

   *  the router-id is taken from the Router-Id TLV that precedes the
      Update TLV and may be shared among multiple Update TLVs
      (<a href="#section-4.6.7">Section 4.6.7</a>);

   *  the next hop is taken either from the source address of the
      network-layer packet that contains the Babel packet or from an
      explicit Next Hop TLV (<a href="#section-4.6.8">Section 4.6.8</a>).

   In addition to the above, an Update TLV can omit a prefix of the
   prefix being announced, which is then extracted from the preceding
   Update TLV in the same address family (IPv4 or IPv6).  Finally, as a
   special optimisation for the case when a router-id coincides with the
   interface-id part of an IPv6 address, the Router-Id TLV itself may be
   omitted, and the router-id is derived from the low-order bits of the
   advertised prefix (<a href="#section-4.6.9">Section 4.6.9</a>).

   In order to implement these compression techniques, Babel uses a
   stateful parser: a TLV may refer to data from a previous TLV.  The
   parser state consists of the following pieces of data:

   *  for each address encoding that allows compression, the current
      default prefix: this is undefined at the start of the packet and
      is updated by each Update TLV with the Prefix flag set
      (<a href="#section-4.6.9">Section 4.6.9</a>);

   *  for each address family (IPv4 or IPv6), the current next hop: this
      is the source address of the enclosing packet for the matching
      address family at the start of a packet, and it is updated by each
      Next Hop TLV (<a href="#section-4.6.8">Section 4.6.8</a>);

   *  the current router-id: this is undefined at the start of the
      packet, and it is updated by each Router-Id TLV (<a href="#section-4.6.7">Section 4.6.7</a>)
      and by each Update TLV with Router-Id flag set.

   Since the parser state must be identical across implementations, it
   is updated before checking for mandatory sub-TLVs: parsing a TLV MUST
   update the parser state even if the TLV is otherwise ignored due to
   an unknown mandatory sub-TLV or for any other reason.

   None of the TLVs that modify the parser state are allowed in the
   packet trailer; hence, an implementation may choose to use a
   dedicated stateless parser to parse the packet trailer.

   This TLV is sent by a node upon receiving an Acknowledgment Request
   TLV.

   Fields:

   Type      Set to 3 to indicate an Acknowledgment TLV.

   Length    The length of the body in octets, exclusive of the Type and
             Length fields.

   Opaque    Set to the Opaque value of the Acknowledgment Request that
             prompted this Acknowledgment.

   Since Opaque values are not globally unique, this TLV MUST be sent to
   a unicast address.

   This TLV is used for neighbour discovery and for determining a
   neighbour&#x27;s reception cost.

   Fields:

   Type      Set to 4 to indicate a Hello TLV.

   Length    The length of the body in octets, exclusive of the Type and
             Length fields.

   Flags     The individual bits of this field specify special handling
             of this TLV (see below).

   Seqno     If the Unicast flag is set, this is the value of the
             sending node&#x27;s outgoing Unicast Hello seqno for this
             neighbour.  Otherwise, it is the sending node&#x27;s outgoing
             Multicast Hello seqno for this interface.

   Interval  If nonzero, this is an upper bound, expressed in
             centiseconds, on the time after which the sending node will
             send a new scheduled Hello TLV with the same setting of the
             Unicast flag.  If this is 0, then this Hello represents an
             unscheduled Hello and doesn&#x27;t carry any new information
             about times at which Hellos are sent.

   The Flags field is interpreted as follows:

    0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |U|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   U (Unicast) flag (8000 hexadecimal):  if set, then this Hello
             represents a Unicast Hello, otherwise it represents a
             Multicast Hello;

   X:        all other bits MUST be sent as 0 and silently ignored on
             reception.

   Every time a Hello is sent, the corresponding seqno counter MUST be
   incremented.  Since there is a single seqno counter for all the
   Multicast Hellos sent by a given node over a given interface, if the
   Unicast flag is not set, this TLV MUST be sent to all neighbours on
   this link, which can be achieved by sending to a multicast
   destination or by sending multiple packets to the unicast addresses
   of all reachable neighbours.  Conversely, if the Unicast flag is set,
   this TLV MUST be sent to a single neighbour, which can achieved by
   sending to a unicast destination.  In order to avoid large
   discontinuities in link quality, multiple Hello TLVs SHOULD NOT be
   sent in the same packet.

   This TLV is self-terminating and allows sub-TLVs.

   An IHU (&quot;I Heard You&quot;) TLV is used for confirming bidirectional
   reachability and carrying a link&#x27;s transmission cost.

   Fields:

   Type      Set to 5 to indicate an IHU TLV.

   Length    The length of the body in octets, exclusive of the Type and
             Length fields.

   AE        The encoding of the Address field.  This should be 1 or 3
             in most cases.  As an optimisation, it MAY be 0 if the TLV
             is sent to a unicast address, if the association is over a
             point-to-point link, or when bidirectional reachability is
             ascertained by means outside of the Babel protocol.

   Reserved  Sent as 0 and MUST be ignored on reception.

   Rxcost    The rxcost according to the sending node of the interface
             whose address is specified in the Address field.  The value
             FFFF hexadecimal (infinity) indicates that this interface
             is unreachable.

   Interval  An upper bound, expressed in centiseconds, on the time
             after which the sending node will send a new IHU; this MUST
             NOT be 0.  The receiving node will use this value in order
             to compute a hold time for this symmetric association.

   Address   The address of the destination node, in the format
             specified by the AE field.  Address compression is not
             allowed.

   Conceptually, an IHU is destined to a single neighbour.  However, IHU
   TLVs contain an explicit destination address, and MAY be sent to a
   multicast address, as this allows aggregation of IHUs destined to
   distinct neighbours into a single packet and avoids the need for an
   ARP or Neighbour Discovery exchange when a neighbour is not being
   used for data traffic.

   IHU TLVs with an unknown value in the AE field MUST be silently
   ignored.

   This TLV is self-terminating and allows sub-TLVs.

   Fields:

   Type      Set to 7 to indicate a Next Hop TLV.

   Length    The length of the body in octets, exclusive of the Type and
             Length fields.

   AE        The encoding of the Address field.  This SHOULD be 1 (IPv4)
             or 3 (link-local IPv6), and MUST NOT be 0.

   Reserved  Sent as 0 and MUST be ignored on reception.

   Next hop  The next-hop address advertised by subsequent Update TLVs
             for this address family.

   When the address family matches the network-layer protocol over which
   this packet is transported, a Next Hop TLV is not needed: in the
   absence of a Next Hop TLV in a given address family, the next-hop
   address is taken to be the source address of the packet.

   An Update TLV advertises or retracts a route.  As an optimisation, it
   can optionally have the side effect of establishing a new implied
   router-id and a new default prefix, as described in <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>.

   Fields:

   Type      Set to 8 to indicate an Update TLV.

   Length    The length of the body in octets, exclusive of the Type and
             Length fields.

   AE        The encoding of the Prefix field.

   Flags     The individual bits of this field specify special handling
             of this TLV (see below).

   Plen      The length in bits of the advertised prefix.  If AE is 3
             (link-local IPv6), the Omitted field MUST be 0.

   Omitted   The number of octets that have been omitted at the
             beginning of the advertised prefix and that should be taken
             from a preceding Update TLV in the same address family with
             the Prefix flag set.

   Interval  An upper bound, expressed in centiseconds, on the time
             after which the sending node will send a new update for
             this prefix.  This MUST NOT be 0.  The receiving node will
             use this value to compute a hold time for the route table
             entry.  The value FFFF hexadecimal (infinity) expresses
             that this announcement will not be repeated unless a
             request is received (<a href="#section-3.8.2.3">Section 3.8.2.3</a>).

   Seqno     The originator&#x27;s sequence number for this update.

   Metric    The sender&#x27;s metric for this route.  The value FFFF
             hexadecimal (infinity) means that this is a route
             retraction.

   Prefix    The prefix being advertised.  This field&#x27;s size is
             (Plen/8 - Omitted) rounded upwards.

   The Flags field is interpreted as follows:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |P|R|X|X|X|X|X|X|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   P (Prefix) flag (80 hexadecimal):  if set, then this Update TLV
             establishes a new default prefix for subsequent Update TLVs
             with a matching address encoding within the same packet,
             even if this TLV is otherwise ignored due to an unknown
             mandatory sub-TLV;

   R (Router-Id) flag (40 hexadecimal):  if set, then this TLV
             establishes a new default router-id for this TLV and
             subsequent Update TLVs in the same packet, even if this TLV
             is otherwise ignored due to an unknown mandatory sub-TLV.
             This router-id is computed from the first address of the
             advertised prefix as follows:

             *  if the length of the address is 8 octets or more, then
                the new router-id is taken from the 8 last octets of the
                address;

             *  if the length of the address is smaller than 8 octets,
                then the new router-id consists of the required number
                of zero octets followed by the address, i.e., the
                address is stored on the right of the router-id.  For
                example, for an IPv4 address, the router-id consists of
                4 octets of zeroes followed by the IPv4 address.

   X:        all other bits MUST be sent as 0 and silently ignored on
             reception.

   The prefix being advertised by an Update TLV is computed as follows:

   *  the first Omitted octets of the prefix are taken from the previous
      Update TLV with the Prefix flag set and the same address encoding,
      even if it was ignored due to an unknown mandatory sub-TLV; if the
      Omitted field is not zero and there is no such TLV, then this
      Update MUST be ignored;

   *  the next (Plen/8 - Omitted) rounded upwards octets are taken from
      the Prefix field;

   *  if Plen is not a multiple of 8, then any bits beyond Plen (i.e.,
      the low-order (8 - Plen MOD 8) bits of the last octet) are
      cleared;

   *  the remaining octets are set to 0.

   If the Metric field is finite, the router-id of the originating node
   for this announcement is taken from the prefix advertised by this
   Update if the Router-Id flag is set, computed as described above.
   Otherwise, it is taken either from the preceding Router-Id TLV, or
   the preceding Update TLV with the Router-Id flag set, whichever comes
   last, even if that TLV is otherwise ignored due to an unknown
   mandatory sub-TLV; if there is no suitable TLV, then this update is
   ignored.

   The next-hop address for this update is taken from the last preceding
   Next Hop TLV with a matching address family (IPv4 or IPv6) in the
   same packet even if it was otherwise ignored due to an unknown
   mandatory sub-TLV; if no such TLV exists, it is taken from the
   network-layer source address of this packet if it belongs to the same
   address family as the prefix being announced; otherwise, this Update
   MUST be ignored.

   If the metric field is FFFF hexadecimal, this TLV specifies a
   retraction.  In that case, the router-id, next hop, and seqno are not
   used.  AE MAY then be 0, in which case this Update retracts all of
   the routes previously advertised by the sending interface.  If the
   metric is finite, AE MUST NOT be 0; Update TLVs with finite metric
   and AE equal to 0 MUST be ignored.  If the metric is infinite and AE
   is 0, Plen and Omitted MUST both be 0; Update TLVs that do not
   satisfy this requirement MUST be ignored.

   Update TLVs with an unknown value in the AE field MUST be silently
   ignored.

   This TLV is self-terminating and allows sub-TLVs.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   As defined in this document, Babel is a completely insecure protocol.
   Without additional security mechanisms, Babel trusts any information
   it receives in plaintext UDP datagrams and acts on it.  An attacker
   that is present on the local network can impact Babel operation in a
   variety of ways; for example they can:

   *  spoof a Babel packet, and redirect traffic by announcing a route
      with a smaller metric, a larger sequence number, or a longer
      prefix;

   *  spoof a malformed packet, which could cause an insufficiently
      robust implementation to crash or interfere with the rest of the
      network;

   *  replay a previously captured Babel packet, which could cause
      traffic to be redirected, black-holed, or otherwise interfere with
      the network.

   When carried over IPv6, Babel packets are ignored unless they are
   sent from a link-local IPv6 address; since routers don&#x27;t forward
   link-local IPv6 packets, this mitigates the attacks outlined above by
   restricting them to on-link attackers.  No such natural protection
   exists when Babel packets are carried over IPv4, which is one of the
   reasons why it is recommended to deploy Babel over IPv6
   (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).

   It is usually difficult to ensure that packets arriving at a Babel
   node are trusted, even in the case where the local link is believed
   to be secure.  For that reason, it is RECOMMENDED that all Babel
   traffic be protected by an application-layer cryptographic protocol.
   There are currently two suitable mechanisms, which implement
   different trade-offs between implementation simplicity and security:

   *  Babel over DTLS [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8968" title="&quot;Babel Routing Protocol over Datagram Transport Layer Security&quot;">RFC8968</a>] runs the majority of Babel traffic over
      DTLS and leverages DTLS to authenticate nodes and provide
      confidentiality and integrity protection;

   *  MAC authentication [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8967" title="&quot;MAC Authentication for the Babel Routing Protocol&quot;">RFC8967</a>] appends a message authentication code
      (MAC) to every Babel packet to prove that it originated at a node
      that knows a shared secret, and includes sufficient additional
      information to prove that the packet is fresh (not replayed).

   Both mechanisms enable nodes to ignore packets generated by attackers
   without the proper credentials.  They also ensure integrity of
   messages and prevent message replay.  While Babel-DTLS supports
   asymmetric keying and ensures confidentiality, Babel-MAC has a much
   more limited scope (see Sections <a href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>, <a href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>, and <a href="#section-7">7</a> of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8967" title="&quot;MAC Authentication for the Babel Routing Protocol&quot;">RFC8967</a>]).
   Since Babel-MAC is simpler and more lightweight, it is recommended in
   preference to Babel-DTLS in deployments where its limitations are
   acceptable, i.e., when symmetric keying is sufficient and where the
   routing information is not considered confidential.

   Every implementation of Babel SHOULD implement BABEL-MAC.

   One should be aware that the information that a mobile Babel node
   announces to the whole routing domain is sufficient to determine the
   mobile node&#x27;s physical location with reasonable precision, which
   might cause privacy concerns even if the control traffic is protected
   from unauthenticated attackers by a cryptographic mechanism such as
   Babel-DTLS.  This issue may be mitigated somewhat by using randomly
   chosen router-ids and randomly chosen IP addresses, and changing them
   often enough.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Cost and Metric Computation</span>

   The strategy for computing link costs and route metrics is a local
   matter; Babel itself only requires that it comply with the conditions
   given in <a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a> and <a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>.  Different nodes may use
   different strategies in a single network and may use different
   strategies on different interface types.  This section describes a
   set of strategies that have been found to work well in actual
   networks.

   In summary, a node maintains per-neighbour statistics about the last
   16 received Hello TLVs of each kind (Appendix A.1), it computes costs
   by using the 2-out-of-3 strategy (Appendix A.2.1) on wired links and
   Expected Transmission Cost (ETX) (Appendix A.2.2) on wireless links.
   It uses an additive algebra for metric computation (<a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.1" href="#appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Maintaining Hello History</span>

   For each neighbour, a node maintains two sets of Hello history, one
   for each kind of Hello, and an expected sequence number, one for
   Multicast and one for Unicast Hellos.  Each Hello history is a vector
   of 16 bits, where a 1 value represents a received Hello, and a 0
   value a missed Hello.  For each kind of Hello, the expected sequence
   number, written ne, is the sequence number that is expected to be
   carried by the next received Hello from this neighbour.

   Whenever it receives a Hello packet of a given kind from a neighbour,
   a node compares the received sequence number nr for that kind of
   Hello with its expected sequence number ne.  Depending on the outcome
   of this comparison, one of the following actions is taken:

   *  if the two differ by more than 16 (modulo 2^(16)), then the
      sending node has probably rebooted and lost its sequence number;
      the whole associated neighbour table entry is flushed and a new
      one is created;

   *  otherwise, if the received nr is smaller (modulo 2^(16)) than the
      expected sequence number ne, then the sending node has increased
      its Hello interval without our noticing; the receiving node
      removes the last (ne - nr) entries from this neighbour&#x27;s Hello
      history (we &quot;undo history&quot;);

   *  otherwise, if nr is larger (modulo 2^(16)) than ne, then the
      sending node has decreased its Hello interval, and some Hellos
      were lost; the receiving node adds (nr - ne) 0 bits to the Hello
      history (we &quot;fast-forward&quot;).

   The receiving node then appends a 1 bit to the Hello history and sets
   ne to (nr + 1).  If the Interval field of the received Hello is not
   zero, it resets the neighbour&#x27;s hello timer to 1.5 times the
   advertised Interval (the extra margin allows for delay due to
   jitter).

   Whenever either hello timer associated with a neighbour expires, the
   local node adds a 0 bit to the corresponding Hello history, and
   increments the expected Hello number.  If both Hello histories are
   empty (they contain 0 bits only), the neighbour entry is flushed;
   otherwise, the relevant hello timer is reset to the value advertised
   in the last Hello of that kind received from this neighbour (no extra
   margin is necessary in this case, since jitter was already taken into
   account when computing the timeout that has just expired).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.2" href="#appendix-A.2">A.2</a>.  Cost Computation</span>

   This section describes two algorithms suitable for computing costs
   (<a href="#section-3.4.3">Section 3.4.3</a>) based on Hello history.  <a href="#appendix-A.2.1">Appendix A.2.1</a> applies to
   wired links and <a href="#appendix-A.2.2">Appendix A.2.2</a> to wireless links.  RECOMMENDED
   default values of the parameters that appear in these algorithms are
   given in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.2.1" href="#appendix-A.2.1">A.2.1</a>.  k-out-of-j</span>

   K-out-of-j link sensing is suitable for wired links that are either
   up, in which case they only occasionally drop a packet, or down, in
   which case they drop all packets.

   The k-out-of-j strategy is parameterised by two small integers k and
   j, such that 0 &lt; k &lt;= j, and the nominal link cost, a constant C &gt;=
   1.  A node keeps a history of the last j hellos; if k or more of
   those have been correctly received, the link is assumed to be up, and
   the rxcost is set to C; otherwise, the link is assumed to be down,
   and the rxcost is set to infinity.

   Since Babel supports two kinds of Hellos, a Babel node performs k-
   out-of-j twice for each neighbour, once on the Unicast Hello history
   and once on the Multicast Hello history.  If either of the instances
   of k-out-of-j indicates that the link is up, then the link is assumed
   to be up, and the rxcost is set to C; if both instances indicate that
   the link is down, then the link is assumed to be down, and the rxcost
   is set to infinity.  In other words, the resulting rxcost is the
   minimum of the rxcosts yielded by the two instances of k-out-of-j
   link sensing.

   The cost of a link performing k-out-of-j link sensing is defined as
   follows:

   *  cost = FFFF hexadecimal if rxcost = FFFF hexadecimal;

   *  cost = txcost otherwise.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.2.2" href="#appendix-A.2.2">A.2.2</a>.  ETX</span>

   Unlike wired links which are bimodal (either up or down), wireless
   links exhibit continuous variation of the link quality.  Naive
   application of hop-count routing in networks that use wireless links
   for transit tends to select long, lossy links in preference to
   shorter, lossless links, which can dramatically reduce throughput.
   For that reason, a routing protocol designed to support wireless
   links must perform some form of link quality estimation.

   The Expected Transmission Cost algorithm, or ETX [<a href="#ref-ETX" title="&quot;A high-throughput path metric for multi-hop wireless networks&quot;">ETX</a>], is a simple
   link quality estimation algorithm that is designed to work well with
   the IEEE 802.11 MAC [<a href="#ref-IEEE802.11">IEEE802.11</a>].  By default, the IEEE 802.11 MAC
   performs Automatic Repeat Query (ARQ) and rate adaptation on unicast
   frames, but not on multicast frames, which are sent at a fixed rate
   with no ARQ; therefore, measuring the loss rate of multicast frames
   yields a useful estimate of a link&#x27;s quality.

   A node performing ETX link quality estimation uses a neighbour&#x27;s
   Multicast Hello history to compute an estimate, written beta, of the
   probability that a Hello TLV is successfully received.  Beta can be
   computed as the fraction of 1 bits within a small number (say, 6) of
   the most recent entries in the Multicast Hello history, or it can be
   an exponential average, or some combination of both approaches.  Let
   rxcost be 256/beta.

   Let alpha be MIN(1, 256/txcost), an estimate of the probability of
   successfully sending a Hello TLV.  The cost is then computed by

      cost = 256/(alpha * beta)

   or, equivalently,

      cost = (MAX(txcost, 256) * rxcost) / 256.

   Since the IEEE 802.11 MAC performs ARQ on unicast frames, unicast
   frames do not provide a useful measure of link quality, and therefore
   ETX ignores the Unicast Hello history.  Thus, a node performing ETX
   link quality estimation will not route through neighbouring nodes
   unless they send periodic Multicast Hellos (possibly in addition to
   Unicast Hellos).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.3" href="#appendix-A.3">A.3</a>.  Route Selection and Hysteresis</span>

   Route selection (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>) is the process by which a node selects
   a single route among the routes that it has available towards a given
   destination.  With Babel, any route selection procedure that only
   ever chooses feasible routes with a finite metric will yield a set of
   loop-free routes; however, in the presence of continuously variable
   metrics such as ETX (Appendix A.2.2), a naive route selection
   procedure might lead to persistent oscillations.  Such oscillations
   can be limited or avoided altogether by implementing hysteresis
   within the route selection algorithm, i.e., by making the route
   selection algorithm sensitive to a route&#x27;s history.  Any reasonable
   hysteresis algorithm should yield good results; the following
   algorithm is simple to implement and has been successfully deployed
   in a variety of environments.

   For every route R, in addition to the route&#x27;s metric m(R), maintain a
   smoothed version of m(R) written ms(R) (we RECOMMEND computing ms(R)
   as an exponentially smoothed average (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc793#section-3.7">Section&nbsp;3.7 of [RFC793]</a>) of
   m(R) with a time constant equal to the Hello interval multiplied by a
   small number such as 3).  If no route to a given destination is
   selected, then select the route with the smallest metric, ignoring
   the smoothed metric.  If a route R is selected, then switch to a
   route R&#x27; only when both m(R&#x27;) &lt; m(R) and ms(R&#x27;) &lt; ms(R).

   Intuitively, the smoothed metric is a long-term estimate of the
   quality of a route.  The algorithm above works by only switching
   routes when both the instantaneous and the long-term estimates of the
   route&#x27;s quality indicate that switching is profitable.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B" href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Protocol Parameters</span>

   The choice of time constants is a trade-off between fast detection of
   mobility events and protocol overhead.  Two instances of Babel
   running with different time constants will interoperate, although the
   resulting worst-case convergence time will be dictated by the slower
   of the two.

   The Hello interval is the most important time constant: an outage or
   a mobility event is detected within 1.5 to 3.5 Hello intervals.  Due
   to Babel&#x27;s use of a redundant route table, and due to its reliance on
   triggered updates and explicit requests, the Update interval has
   little influence on the time needed to reconverge after an outage: in
   practice, it only has a significant effect on the time needed to
   acquire new routes after a mobility event.  While the protocol allows
   intervals as low as 10 ms, such low values would cause significant
   amounts of protocol traffic for little practical benefit.

   The following values have been found to work well in a variety of
   environments and are therefore RECOMMENDED default values:

   Multicast Hello interval:  4 seconds.

   Unicast Hello interval:  infinite (no Unicast Hellos are sent).

   Link cost:  estimated using ETX on wireless links; 2-out-of-3 with
             C=96 on wired links.

   IHU interval:  the advertised IHU interval is always 3 times the
             Multicast Hello interval.  IHUs are actually sent with each
             Hello on lossy links (as determined from the Hello
             history), but only with every third Multicast Hello on
             lossless links.

   Update interval:  4 times the Multicast Hello interval.

   IHU Hold time:  3.5 times the advertised IHU interval.

   Route Expiry time:  3.5 times the advertised update interval.

   Request timeout:  initially 2 seconds, doubled every time a request
             is resent, up to a maximum of three times.

   Urgent timeout:  0.2 seconds.

   Source GC time:  3 minutes.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C" href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  Route Filtering</span>

   Route filtering is a procedure where an instance of a routing
   protocol either discards some of the routes announced by its
   neighbours or learns them with a metric that is higher than what
   would be expected.  Like all distance-vector protocols, Babel has the
   ability to apply arbitrary filtering to the routes it learns, and
   implementations of Babel that apply different sets of filtering rules
   will interoperate without causing routing loops.  The protocol&#x27;s
   ability to perform route filtering is a consequence of the latitude
   given in <a href="#section-3.5.2">Section 3.5.2</a>: Babel can use any metric that is strictly
   monotonic, including one that assigns an infinite metric to a
   selected subset of routes.  (See also <a href="#section-3.8.1">Section 3.8.1</a>, where requests
   for nonexistent routes are treated in the same way as requests for
   routes with infinite metric.)

   It is not in general correct to learn a route with a metric smaller
   than the one it was announced with, or to replace a route&#x27;s
   destination prefix with a more specific (longer) one.  Doing either
   of these may cause persistent routing loops.

   Route filtering is a useful tool, since it allows fine-grained tuning
   of the routing decisions made by the routing protocol.  Accordingly,
   some implementations of Babel implement a rich configuration language
   that allows applying filtering to sets of routes defined, for
   example, by incoming interface and destination prefix.

   In order to limit the consequences of misconfiguration, Babel
   implementations provide a reasonable set of default filtering rules
   even when they don&#x27;t allow configuration of filtering by the user.
   At a minimum, they discard routes with a destination prefix in
   fe80::/64, ff00::/8, 127.0.0.1/32, 0.0.0.0/32, and 224.0.0.0/8.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-D" href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a>.  Considerations for Protocol Extensions</span>

   Babel is an extensible protocol, and this document defines a number
   of mechanisms that can be used to extend the protocol in a backwards
   compatible manner:

   *  increasing the version number in the packet header;

   *  defining new TLVs;

   *  defining new sub-TLVs (with or without the mandatory bit set);

   *  defining new AEs;

   *  using the packet trailer.

   This appendix is intended to guide designers of protocol extensions
   in choosing a particular encoding.

   The version number in the Babel header should only be increased if
   the new version is not backwards compatible with the original
   protocol.

   In many cases, an extension could be implemented either by defining a
   new TLV or by adding a new sub-TLV to an existing TLV.  For example,
   an extension whose purpose is to attach additional data to route
   updates can be implemented either by creating a new &quot;enriched&quot; Update
   TLV, by adding a nonmandatory sub-TLV to the Update TLV, or by adding
   a mandatory sub-TLV.

   The various encodings are treated differently by implementations that
   do not understand the extension.  In the case of a new TLV or of a
   sub-TLV with the mandatory bit set, the whole TLV is ignored by
   implementations that do not implement the extension, while in the
   case of a nonmandatory sub-TLV, the TLV is parsed and acted upon, and
   only the unknown sub-TLV is silently ignored.  Therefore, a
   nonmandatory sub-TLV should be used by extensions that extend the
   Update in a compatible manner (the extension data may be silently
   ignored), while a mandatory sub-TLV or a new TLV must be used by
   extensions that make incompatible extensions to the meaning of the
   TLV (the whole TLV must be thrown away if the extension data is not
   understood).

   Experience shows that the need for additional data tends to crop up
   in the most unexpected places.  Hence, it is recommended that
   extensions that define new TLVs should make them self-terminating and
   allow attaching sub-TLVs to them.

   Adding a new AE is essentially equivalent to adding a new TLV: Update
   TLVs with an unknown AE are ignored, just like unknown TLVs.
   However, adding a new AE is more involved than adding a new TLV,
   since it creates a new set of compression state.  Additionally, since
   the Next Hop TLV creates state specific to a given address family, as
   opposed to a given AE, a new AE for a previously defined address
   family must not be used in the Next Hop TLV if backwards
   compatibility is required.  A similar issue arises with Update TLVs
   with unknown AEs establishing a new router-id (due to the Router-Id
   flag being set).  Therefore, defining new AEs must be done with care
   if compatibility with unextended implementations is required.

   The packet trailer is intended to carry cryptographic signatures that
   only cover the packet body; storing the cryptographic signatures in
   the packet trailer avoids clearing the signature before computing a
   hash of the packet body, and makes it possible to check a
   cryptographic signature before running the full, stateful TLV parser.
   Hence, only TLVs that don&#x27;t need to be protected by cryptographic
   security protocols should be allowed in the packet trailer.  Any such
   TLVs should be easy to parse and, in particular, should not require
   stateful parsing.

   Babel is a fairly economic protocol.  Updates take between 12 and 40
   octets per destination, depending on the address family and how
   successful compression is; in a dual-stack flat network, an average
   of less than 24 octets per update is typical.  The route table
   occupies about 35 octets per IPv6 entry.  To put these values into
   perspective, a single full-size Ethernet frame can carry some 65
   route updates, and a megabyte of memory can contain a 20,000-entry
   route table and the associated source table.

   Babel is also a reasonably simple protocol.  One complete
   implementation consists of less than 12,000 lines of C code, and it
   compiles to less than 120 KB of text on a 32-bit CISC architecture;
   about half of this figure is due to protocol extensions and user-
   interface code.

   Nonetheless, in some very constrained environments, such as PDAs,
   microwave ovens, or abacuses, it may be desirable to have subset
   implementations of the protocol.

   There are many different definitions of a stub router, but for the
   needs of this section, a stub implementation of Babel is one that
   announces one or more directly attached prefixes into a Babel network
   but doesn&#x27;t re-announce any routes that it has learnt from its
   neighbours, and always prefers the direct route to a directly
   attached prefix to a route learnt over the Babel protocol, even when
   the prefixes are the same.  It may either maintain a full routing
   table or simply select a default gateway through any one of its
   neighbours that announces a default route.  Since a stub
   implementation never forwards packets except from or to a directly
   attached link, it cannot possibly participate in a routing loop, and
   hence it need not evaluate the feasibility condition or maintain a
   source table.

   No matter how primitive, a stub implementation must parse sub-TLVs
   attached to any TLVs that it understands and check the mandatory bit.
   It must answer acknowledgment requests and must participate in the
   Hello/IHU protocol.  It must also be able to reply to seqno requests
   for routes that it announces, and it should be able to reply to route
   requests.

   Experience shows that an IPv6-only stub implementation of Babel can
   be written in less than 1,000 lines of C code and compile to 13 KB of
   text on 32-bit CISC architecture.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-F" href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a>.  Compatibility with Previous Versions</span>

   The protocol defined in this document is a successor to the protocol
   defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6126" title="&quot;The Babel Routing Protocol&quot;">RFC6126</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7557" title="&quot;Extension Mechanism for the Babel Routing Protocol&quot;">RFC7557</a>].  While the two protocols are not
   entirely compatible, the new protocol has been designed so that it
   can be deployed in existing <a href="/doc/html/rfc6126">RFC 6126</a> networks without requiring a
   flag day.

   There are three optional features that make this protocol
   incompatible with its predecessor.  First of all, <a href="/doc/html/rfc6126">RFC 6126</a> did not
   define Unicast Hellos (<a href="#section-3.4.1">Section 3.4.1</a>), and an implementation of <a href="/doc/html/rfc6126">RFC</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc6126">6126</a> will misinterpret a Unicast Hello for a Multicast one; since the
   sequence number space of Unicast Hellos is distinct from the sequence
   number space of Multicast Hellos, sending a Unicast Hello to an
   implementation of <a href="/doc/html/rfc6126">RFC 6126</a> will confuse its link quality estimator.
   Second, <a href="/doc/html/rfc6126">RFC 6126</a> did not define unscheduled Hellos, and an
   implementation of <a href="/doc/html/rfc6126">RFC 6126</a> will mis-parse Hellos with an interval
   equal to 0.  Finally, <a href="/doc/html/rfc7557">RFC 7557</a> did not define mandatory sub-TLVs
   (<a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>), and thus an implementation of RFCs 6126 and 7557 will
   not correctly ignore a TLV that carries an unknown mandatory sub-TLV;
   depending on the sub-TLV, this might cause routing pathologies.

   An implementation of this specification that never sends Unicast or
   unscheduled Hellos and doesn&#x27;t implement any extensions that use
   mandatory sub-TLVs is safe to deploy in a network in which some nodes
   implement the protocol described in RFCs 6126 and 7557.

   Two changes need to be made to an implementation of RFCs 6126 and
   7557 so that it can safely interoperate in all cases with
   implementations of this protocol.  First, it needs to be modified
   either to ignore or to process Unicast and unscheduled Hellos.
   Second, it needs to be modified to parse sub-TLVs of all the TLVs
   that it understands and that allow sub-TLVs, and to ignore the TLV if
   an unknown mandatory sub-TLV is found.  It is not necessary to parse
   unknown TLVs, as these are ignored in any case.

   There are other changes, but these are not of a nature to prevent
   interoperability:

   *  the conditions on route acquisition (<a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a>) have been
      relaxed;

   *  route selection should no longer use the route&#x27;s sequence number
      (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>);

   *  the format of the packet trailer has been defined (<a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>);

   *  router-ids with a value of all-zeros or all-ones have been
      forbidden (<a href="#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3</a>);

   *  the compression state is now specific to an address family rather
      than an address encoding (<a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>);

   *  packet pacing is now recommended (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).
