Abstract

   To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions
   need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments
   aspects specified as Type-P for test packets.  This memo updates the
   IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330">RFC 2330</a>, with advanced
   considerations for measurement methodology and testing.  The existing
   framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a
   single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path
   when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and
   test stream descriptions must evolve with them; otherwise, unexpected
   network features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo
   describes new stream parameters for both network characterization and
   support of application design using IPPM metrics.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IETF IPPM working group first created a framework for metric
   development in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>].  This framework has stood the test of time
   and enabled development of many fundamental metrics, while only being
   updated once in a specific area [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5835" title="&quot;Framework for Metric Composition&quot;">RFC5835</a>].

   The IPPM framework [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] generally relies on several assumptions,
   one of which is not explicitly stated but assumed: lightly loaded
   paths conform to the linear &quot;serialization delay = packet size /
   capacity&quot; equation, and they are state-less or history-less (with
   some exceptions, e.g., firewalls are mentioned).  However, this does
   not hold true for many modern network technologies, such as reactive
   paths (those with demand-driven resource allocation) and links with
   time-slotted operation.  Per-flow state can be observed on test
   packet streams, and such treatment will influence network
   characterization if it is not taken into account.  Flow history will
   also affect the performance of applications and be perceived by their
   users.

   Moreover, Sections <a href="#section-4">4</a> and <a href="#section-6.2">6.2</a> of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] explicitly recommend
   repeatable measurement metrics and methodologies.  Measurements in
   today&#x27;s access networks illustrate that methodological guidelines of
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] must be extended to capture the reactive nature of these
   networks.  There are proposed extensions to allow methodologies to
   fulfill the continuity requirement stated in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-6.2">Section&nbsp;6.2 of
   [RFC2330]</a>, but it is impossible to guarantee they can do so.
   Practical measurements confirm that some link types exhibit distinct
   responses to repeated measurements with identical stimulus, i.e.,
   identical traffic patterns.  If feasible, appropriate fine-tuning of
   measurement traffic patterns can improve measurement continuity and
   repeatability for these link types as shown in [<a href="#ref-IBD" title="&quot;The Illusion of Being Deterministic - Application-Level Considerations on Delay in 3G HSPA Networks&quot;">IBD</a>].

   This memo updates the IPPM framework [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] with advanced
   considerations for measurement methodology and testing.  We note that
   the scope of IPPM work at the time of the publication of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>]
   (and during more than a decade that followed) was limited to active
   techniques or those that generate packet streams that are dedicated
   to measurement and do not monitor user traffic.  This memo retains
   that same scope.

   We stress that this update of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] does not invalidate or
   require changes to the analytic metric definitions prepared in the
   IPPM working group to date.  Rather, it adds considerations for
   active measurement methodologies and expands the importance of
   existing conventions and notions in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>], such as &quot;packets of
   Type-P&quot;.

   Among the evolutionary networking changes is a phenomenon we call
   &quot;reactive behavior&quot;, as defined below.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Definition: Reactive Path Behavior</span>

   Reactive path behavior will be observable by the test packet stream
   as a repeatable phenomenon where packet transfer performance
   characteristics *change* according to prior observations of the
   packet flow of interest (at the reactive host or link).  Therefore,
   reactive path behavior is nominally deterministic with respect to the
   flow of interest.  Other flows or traffic load conditions may result
   in additional performance-affecting reactions, but these are external
   to the characteristics of the flow of interest.

   In practice, a sender may not have absolute control of the ingress
   packet stream characteristics at a reactive host or link, but this
   does not change the deterministic reactions present there.  If we
   measure a path, the arrival characteristics at the reactive host/link
   are determined by the sending characteristics and the transfer
   characteristics of intervening hosts and links.  Identical traffic
   patterns at the sending host might generate different patterns at the
   input of the reactive host/link due to impairments in the
   intermediate subpath.  The reactive host/link is expected to provide
   a deterministic response on identical input patterns (composed of all
   flows, including the flow of interest).

   Other than the size of the payload at the layer of interest and the
   header itself, packet content does not influence the measurement.
   Reactive behavior at the IP layer is not influenced by the TCP ports
   in use, for example.  Therefore, the indication of reactive behavior
   must include the layer at which measurements are instituted.

   Examples include links with Active/Inactive state detectors, and
   hosts or links that revise their traffic serving and forwarding rates
   (up or down) based on packet arrival history.

   Although difficult to handle from a measurement point of view,
   reactive paths&#x27; entities are usually designed to improve overall
   network performance and user experience, for example, by making
   capacity available to an active user.  Reactive behavior may be an
   artifact of solutions to allocate scarce resources according to the
   demands of users; thus, it is an important problem to solve for
   measurement and other disciplines, such as application design.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Scope</span>

   The purpose of this memo is to foster repeatable measurement results
   in modern networks by highlighting the key aspects of test streams
   and packets and making them part of the IPPM framework.

   The scope is to update key sections of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>], adding
   considerations that will aid the development of new measurement
   methodologies intended for today&#x27;s IP networks.  Specifically, this
   memo describes useful stream parameters that complement the
   parameters discussed in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-11.1">Section&nbsp;11.1 of [RFC2330]</a> and the parameters
   described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3432#section-4.2">Section&nbsp;4.2 of [RFC3432]</a> for periodic streams.

   The memo also provides new considerations to update the criteria for
   metrics in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-4">Section&nbsp;4 of [RFC2330]</a>, the measurement methodology in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-6.2">Section&nbsp;6.2 of [RFC2330]</a>, and other topics related to the quality of
   metrics and methods (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).

   Other topics in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] that might be updated or augmented are
   deferred to future work.  This includes the topics of passive and
   various forms of hybrid active/passive measurements.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  New or Revised Stream Parameters</span>

   There are several areas where measurement methodology definition and
   test result interpretation will benefit from an increased
   understanding of the stream characteristics and the (possibly
   unknown) network conditions that influence the measured metrics.

   1.  Network treatment depends on the fullest extent on the &quot;packet of
       Type-P&quot; definition in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>], and has for some time.

       *  State is often maintained on the per-flow basis at various
          points in the path, where &quot;flows&quot; are determined by IP and
          other layers.  Significant treatment differences occur with
          the simplest of Type-P parameters: packet length.  Use of
          multiple lengths is RECOMMENDED.

       *  Payload content optimization (compression or format
          conversion) in intermediate segments breaks the convention of
          payload correspondence when correlating measurements are made
          at different points in a path.



<span class="grey">Fabini &amp; Morton               Informational                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-6" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc7312">RFC 7312</a>                    Advanced Sampling                August 2014</span>


   2.  Packet history (instantaneous or recent test rate or inactivity,
       also for non-test traffic) profoundly influences measured
       performance, in addition to all the Type-P parameters described
       in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>].

   3.  Access technology may change during testing.  A range of transfer
       capacities and access methods may be encountered during a test
       session.  When different interfaces are used, the host seeking
       access will be aware of the technology change, which
       differentiates this form of path change from other changes in
       network state.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-14">Section&nbsp;14 of [RFC2330]</a> addresses the possibility
       that a host may have more than one attachment to the network, and
       also that assessment of the measurement path (route) is valid for
       some length of time (in Sections <a href="#section-5">5</a> and <a href="#section-7">7</a> of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>]).  Here, we
       combine these two considerations under the assumption that
       changes may be more frequent and possibly have greater
       consequences on performance metrics.

   4.  Paths including links or nodes with time-slotted service
       opportunities represent several challenges to measurement (when
       the service time period is appreciable):

       *  Random/unbiased sampling is not possible beyond one such link
          in the path.

       *  The above encourages a segmented approach to end-to-end
          measurement, as described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6049" title="&quot;Spatial Composition of Metrics&quot;">RFC6049</a>] for Network
          Characterization (as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6703" title="&quot;Reporting IP Network Performance Metrics: Different Points of View&quot;">RFC6703</a>]), to understand the
          full range of delay and delay variation on the path.
          Alternatively, if application performance estimation is the
          goal (also defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6703" title="&quot;Reporting IP Network Performance Metrics: Different Points of View&quot;">RFC6703</a>]), then a stream with unbiased
          or known-bias properties [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3432" title="&quot;Network performance measurement with periodic streams&quot;">RFC3432</a>] may be sufficient.

       *  Multi-modal delay variation makes central statistics
          unimportant; others must be used instead.

   Each of these topics is treated in detail below.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Test Packet Type-P</span>

   We recommend two Type-P parameters to be added to the factors that
   have impact on path performance measurements, namely packet length
   and payload type.  Carefully choosing these parameters can improve
   measurement methodologies in their continuity and repeatability when
   deployed in reactive paths.






<span class="grey">Fabini &amp; Morton               Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc7312">RFC 7312</a>                    Advanced Sampling                August 2014</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.1" href="#section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Multiple Test Packet Lengths</span>

   Many instances of network characterization using IPPM metrics have
   relied on a single test packet length.  When testing to assess
   application performance or an aggregate of traffic, benchmarking
   methods have used a range of fixed lengths and frequently augmented
   fixed-size tests with a mixture of sizes, or Internet Mix (IMIX) as
   described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6985" title="&quot;IMIX Genome: Specification of Variable Packet Sizes for Additional Testing&quot;">RFC6985</a>].

   Test packet length influences delay measurements, in that the IPPM
   one-way delay metric [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2679" title="&quot;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM&quot;">RFC2679</a>] includes serialization time in its
   first-bit to last-bit timestamping requirements.  However, different
   sizes can have a larger influence on link delay and link delay
   variation than serialization would explain alone.  This effect can be
   non-linear and change the instantaneous network performance when a
   different size is used, or the performance of packets following the
   size change.

   Repeatability is a main measurement methodology goal as stated in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-6.2">Section&nbsp;6.2 of [RFC2330]</a>.  To eliminate packet length as a potential
   measurement uncertainty factor, successive measurements must use
   identical traffic patterns.  In practice, a combination of random
   payload and random start time can yield representative results as
   illustrated in [<a href="#ref-IRR" title="&quot;The Importance of Being Really Random: Methodological Aspects of IP-Layer 2G and 3G Network Delay Assessment&quot;">IRR</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.2" href="#section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Test Packet Payload Content Optimization</span>

   The aim for efficient network resource use has resulted in deployment
   of server-only or client-server lossless or lossy payload compression
   techniques on some links or paths.  These optimizers attempt to
   compress high-volume traffic in order to reduce network load.  Files
   are analyzed by application-layer parsers, and parts (like comments)
   might be dropped.  Although typically acting on HTTP or JPEG files,
   compression might affect measurement packets, too.  In particular,
   measurement packets are qualified for efficient compression when they
   use standard plain-text payload.  We note that use of transport-layer
   encryption will counteract the deployment of network-based analysis
   and may reduce the adoption of payload optimizations, however.

   IPPM-conforming measurements should add packet payload content as a
   Type-P parameter, which can help to improve measurement determinism.
   Some packet payloads are more susceptible to compression than others,
   but optimizers in the measurement path can be out ruled by using
   incompressible packet payload.  This payload content could be
   supplied by a pseudo-random sequence generator or by using part of a
   compressed file (e.g., a part of a ZIP compressed archive).





<span class="grey">Fabini &amp; Morton               Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc7312">RFC 7312</a>                    Advanced Sampling                August 2014</span>


   Optimization can go beyond the scope of one single data or
   measurement stream.  Many more client- or network-centric
   optimization technologies have been proposed or standardized so far,
   including Robust Header Compression (ROHC) and Voice over IP
   aggregation as presented, for instance, in [<a href="#ref-EEAW" title="&quot;Empirical Evaluation of VoIP Aggregation over a Fixed WiMAX Testbed&quot;">EEAW</a>].  Where
   optimization is feasible and valuable, many more of these
   technologies may follow.  As a general observation, the more
   concurrent flows an intermediate host treats and the longer the paths
   shared by flows are, the higher becomes the incentive of hosts to
   aggregate flows belonging to distinct sources.  Measurements should
   consider this potential additional source of uncertainty with respect
   to repeatability.  Aggregation of flows in networking devices can,
   for instance, result in reciprocal timing and performance influence
   of these flows, which may exceed typical reciprocal queueing effects
   by orders of magnitude.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Packet History</span>

   Recent packet history and instantaneous data rate influence
   measurement results for reactive links supporting on-demand capacity
   allocation.  Measurement uncertainty may be reduced by knowledge of
   measurement packet history and total host load.  Additionally, small
   changes in history, e.g., because of lost packets along the path, can
   be the cause of large performance variations.

   For instance, delay in reactive 3G networks like High Speed Packet
   Access (HSPA) depends to a large extent on the test traffic data
   rate.  The reactive resource allocation strategy in these networks
   affects the uplink direction in particular.  Small changes in data
   rate can be the reason of more than a 200% increase in delay,
   depending on the specific packet size.  A detailed theoretical and
   practical analysis of Radio Resource Control (RRC) link transitions,
   which can cause such behavior in Universal Mobile Terrestrial System
   (UMTS) networks, is presented, e.g., in [<a href="#ref-RRC" title="&quot;Theory and Practice of RRC State Transitions in UMTS Networks&quot;">RRC</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Access Technology Change</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC2330">RFC2330</a>] discussed the scenario of multi-homed hosts.  If hosts
   become aware of access technology changes (e.g., because of IP
   address changes or lower-layer information) and make this information
   available, measurement methodologies can use this information to
   improve measurement representativeness and relevance.

   However, today&#x27;s various access network technologies can present the
   same physical interface to the host.  A host may or may not become
   aware when its access technology changes on such an interface.
   Measurements for paths that support on-demand capacity allocation
   are, therefore, challenging in that it is difficult to differentiate



<span class="grey">Fabini &amp; Morton               Informational                     [Page 8]</span></pre>

   between access technology changes (e.g., because of mobility) and
   reactive path behavior (e.g., because of data rate change).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Time-Slotted Randomness Cancellation</span>

   Time-slotted operation of path entities -- interfaces, routers, or
   links -- in a network path is a particular challenge for
   measurements, especially if the time-slot period is substantial.  The
   central observation as an extension to Poisson stream sampling in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] is that the first such time-slotted component cancels
   unbiased measurement stream sampling.  In the worst case, time-
   slotted operation converts an unbiased, random measurement packet
   stream into a periodic packet stream.  Being heavily biased, these
   packets may interact with periodic behavior of subsequent time-
   slotted network entities [<a href="#ref-TSRC" title="&quot;Delay Measurement Methodology Revisited: Time-slotted Randomness Cancellation&quot;">TSRC</a>].

   Time-slotted randomness cancellation (TSRC) sources can be found in
   virtually any system, network component or path, their impact on
   measurements being a matter of the order of magnitude when compared
   to the metric under observation.  Examples of TSRC sources include,
   but are not limited to, system clock resolution, operating system
   ticks, time-slotted component or network operation, etc.  The amount
   of measurement bias is determined by the particular measurement
   stream, relative offset between allocated time slots in subsequent
   path entities, delay variation in these paths, and other sources of
   variation.  Measurement results might change over time, depending on
   how accurately the sending host, receiving host, and time-slotted
   components in the measurement path are synchronized to each other and
   to global time.  If path segments maintain flow state, flow parameter
   change or flow reallocations can cause substantial variation in
   measurement results.

   Practical measurements confirm that such interference limits delay
   measurement variation to a subset of theoretical value range.
   Measurement samples for such cases can aggregate on artificial
   limits, generating multi-modal distributions as demonstrated in
   [<a href="#ref-IRR" title="&quot;The Importance of Being Really Random: Methodological Aspects of IP-Layer 2G and 3G Network Delay Assessment&quot;">IRR</a>].  In this context, the desirable measurement sample statistics
   differentiate between multi-modal delay distributions caused by
   reactive path behavior and the ones due to time-slotted interference.

   Measurement methodology selection for time-slotted paths depends to a
   large extent on the respective viewpoint.  End-to-end metrics can
   provide accurate measurement results for short-term sessions and low
   likelihood of flow state modifications.  Applications or services
   that aim at approximating path performance for a short time interval
   (in the order of minutes) and expect stable path conditions should,





<span class="grey">Fabini &amp; Morton               Informational                     [Page 9]</span></pre>

   therefore, prefer end-to-end metrics.  Here, stable path conditions
   refer to any kind of global knowledge concerning measurement path
   flow state and flow parameters.

   However, if long-term forecast of time-slotted path performance is
   the main measurement goal, a segmented approach relying on
   measurement of subpath metrics is preferred.  Regenerating unbiased
   measurement traffic at any hop can help to reveal the true range of
   path performance for all path segments.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Quality of Metrics and Methodologies</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC6808">RFC6808</a>] proposes repeatability and continuity as one of the metric
   and methodology properties to infer on measurement quality.
   Depending mainly on the set of controlled measurement parameters,
   measurements repeated for a specific network path using a specific
   methodology may or may not yield repeatable results.  Challenging
   measurement scenarios for adequate parameter control include
   wireless, reactive, or time-slotted networks as discussed earlier in
   this document.  This section presents an expanded definition of
   &quot;repeatability&quot; beyond the definition in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] and an expanded
   examination of the concept of &quot;continuity&quot; in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] and its
   limited applicability.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Revised Definition of Repeatability</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC2330">RFC2330</a>] defines repeatability in a general way:

   &quot;A methodology for a metric should have the property that it is
   repeatable: if the methodology is used multiple times under identical
   conditions, the same measurements should result in the same
   measurements.&quot;

   The challenge is to develop this definition further, such that it
   becomes an objective measurable criterion (and does not depend on the
   concept of continuity discussed below).  Fortunately, this topic has
   been treated in other IPPM work.  In <a href="/doc/html/bcp176">BCP 176</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6576" title="&quot;IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Standard Advancement Testing&quot;">RFC6576</a>], the criteria
   of equivalent results was agreed as the surrogate for
   interoperability when assessing metric RFCs for Standards Track
   advancement.  The criteria of equivalence were expressed as objective
   statistical requirements for comparison across the same
   implementations and independent implementations in the test plans
   specific to each RFC evaluated ([<a href="/doc/html/rfc2679" title="&quot;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM&quot;">RFC2679</a>] in the test plan of
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6808" title="&quot;Test Plan and Results Supporting Advancement of RFC 2679 on the Standards Track&quot;">RFC6808</a>]).

   The tests of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6808" title="&quot;Test Plan and Results Supporting Advancement of RFC 2679 on the Standards Track&quot;">RFC6808</a>] rely on nearly identical conditions to be
   present for analysis and accept that these conditions cannot be
   exactly identical in the production network paths used.  The test



<span class="grey">Fabini &amp; Morton               Informational                    [Page 10]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-11" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc7312">RFC 7312</a>                    Advanced Sampling                August 2014</span>


   plans allow some correction factors to be applied (some statistical
   tests are hyper-sensitive to differences in the mean of
   distributions) and recognize the original findings of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>]
   regarding excess sample sizes.

   One way to view the reliance on identical conditions is to view it as
   a challenge: How few parameters and path conditions need to be
   controlled and still produce repeatable methods/measurements?

   Although the test plan in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6808" title="&quot;Test Plan and Results Supporting Advancement of RFC 2679 on the Standards Track&quot;">RFC6808</a>] documented numerical criteria for
   equivalence, we cannot specify the exact numerical criteria for
   repeatability *in general*.  The process in the BCP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6576" title="&quot;IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Standard Advancement Testing&quot;">RFC6576</a>] and
   statistics in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6808" title="&quot;Test Plan and Results Supporting Advancement of RFC 2679 on the Standards Track&quot;">RFC6808</a>] have been used successfully, and the
   numerical criteria to declare a metric repeatable should be agreed by
   all interested parties prior to measurement.

   We revise the definition slightly, as follows:

      A methodology for a metric should have the property that it is
      repeatable: if the methodology is used multiple times under
      identical conditions, the methods should produce equivalent
      measurement results.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Continuity No Longer an Alternative Repeatability Criterion</span>

   In the original framework [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>], the concept of continuity was
   introduced to provide a relaxed criteria for judging repeatability
   and was described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-6.2">Section&nbsp;6.2 of [RFC2330]</a> as follows:

   &quot;...a methodology for a given metric exhibits continuity if, for
   small variations in conditions, it results in small variations in the
   resulting measurements.&quot;

   Although there are conditions where metrics may exhibit continuity,
   there are others where this criteria would fail for both user traffic
   and active measurement traffic.  Consider link fragmentation and the
   non-linear increase in delay when we increase packet size just beyond
   the limit of a single fragment.  An active measurement packet would
   see the same delay increase when exceeding the fragment size.

   The Bulk Transfer Capacity (BTC) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3148" title="&quot;A Framework for Defining Empirical Bulk Transfer Capacity Metrics&quot;">RFC3148</a>] gives another example in
   <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a>, bottom of page 2:

      There is also evidence that most TCP implementations exhibit non-
      linear performance over some portion of their operating region.
      It is possible to construct simple simulation examples where
      incremental improvements to a path (such as raising the link data
      rate) results in lower overall TCP throughput (or BTC) [<a href="#ref-Mat98" title="&quot;Empirical Bulk Transfer Capacity&quot;">Mat98</a>].

   Clearly, the time-slotted network elements described in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>
   of this document also qualify as a new exception to the ideal of
   continuity.

      Therefore, we deprecate continuity as an alternate criterion on
      metrics and prefer the more exact evaluation of repeatability
      instead.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Metrics Should Be Actionable</span>

   The IP Performance Metrics Framework [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] includes usefulness as
   a metric criterion:

   &quot;...The metrics must be useful to users and providers in
   understanding the performance they experience or provide...&quot;.

   When considering measurements as part of a maintenance process,
   evaluation of measurement results for a path under observation can
   draw attention to potential performance problems &quot;somewhere&quot; on the
   path.  Anomaly detection is, therefore, an important phase and first
   step that already satisfies the usefulness criterion for many
   metrics.

   This concept of usefulness can be extended, becoming a subset of what
   we refer to as &quot;actionable&quot; criterion in the following.  We note that
   this is not the term from law.

   Central to maintenance is the isolation of the root cause of reported
   anomalies down to a specific subpath, link or host, and metrics
   should support this second step as well.  While detection of path
   anomaly may be the result of an on-going monitoring process, the
   second step of cause isolation consists of specific, directed on-
   demand measurements on components and subpaths.  Metrics must support
   users in this directed search, becoming actionable:

      Metrics must enable users and operators to understand path
      performance and SHOULD help to direct corrective actions when
      warranted, based on the measurement results.

   Besides characterizing metrics, usefulness and actionable properties
   are also applicable to methodologies and measurements.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  It May Not Be Possible To Be Conservative</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC2330">RFC2330</a>] adopts the term &quot;conservative&quot; for measurement
   methodologies for which:

   &quot;... the act of measurement does not modify, or only slightly
   modifies, the value of the performance metric the methodology
   attempts to measure.&quot;

   It should be noted that this definition of &quot;conservative&quot; in the
   sense of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2330" title="&quot;Framework for IP Performance Metrics&quot;">RFC2330</a>] depends to a large extent on the measurement
   path&#x27;s technology and characteristics.  In particular, when deployed
   on reactive paths, subpaths, links or hosts conforming to the
   definition in <a href="#section-1.1">Section 1.1</a> of this document, measurement packets can
   originate capacity (re)allocations.  In addition, small measurement
   flow variations can result in other users on the same path perceiving
   significant variations in measurement results.  Therefore:

      It is not always possible for the method to be conservative.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Spatial and Temporal Composition Support Unbiased Sampling</span>

   Concepts related to temporal and spatial composition of metrics in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-9">Section&nbsp;9 of [RFC2330]</a> have been extended in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5835" title="&quot;Framework for Metric Composition&quot;">RFC5835</a>].  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5835" title="&quot;Framework for Metric Composition&quot;">RFC5835</a>]
   defines multiple new types of metrics, including Spatial Composition,
   Temporal Aggregation, and Spatial Aggregation.  So far, only the
   metrics for Spatial Composition have been standardized [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6049" title="&quot;Spatial Composition of Metrics&quot;">RFC6049</a>],
   providing the ability to estimate the performance of a complete path
   from subpath metrics.  Spatial Composition aligns with the finding of
   [<a href="#ref-TSRC" title="&quot;Delay Measurement Methodology Revisited: Time-slotted Randomness Cancellation&quot;">TSRC</a>] that unbiased sampling is not possible beyond the first time-
   slotted link within a measurement path.

      In cases where unbiased measurement for all segments of a path is
      not feasible due to the presence of a time-slotted link, restoring
      randomness of measurement samples when necessary is recommended as
      presented in [<a href="#ref-TSRC" title="&quot;Delay Measurement Methodology Revisited: Time-slotted Randomness Cancellation&quot;">TSRC</a>], in combination with Spatial Composition
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6049" title="&quot;Spatial Composition of Metrics&quot;">RFC6049</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.6" href="#section-4.6">4.6</a>.  When to Truncate the Poisson Sampling Distribution</span>

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2330#section-11.1.1">Section&nbsp;11.1.1 of [RFC2330]</a> describes Poisson sampling, where the
   inter-packet send times have a Poisson distribution.  A path element
   with reactive behavior sensitive to flow inactivity could change
   state if the random inter-packet time is too long.

      It is recommended to truncate the tail of Poisson distribution
      when needed to avoid reactive element state changes.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc7312">RFC 7312</a>                    Advanced Sampling                August 2014</span>


   Tail truncation has been used without issue to ensure that minimum
   sample sizes can be attained in a fixed-test interval.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Conclusions</span>

   Safeguarding repeatability as a key property of measurement
   methodologies is highly challenging and sometimes impossible in
   reactive paths.  Measurements in paths with demand-driven allocation
   strategies must use a prototypical application packet stream to infer
   a specific application&#x27;s performance.  Measurement repetition with
   unbiased network and flow states (e.g., by rebooting measurement
   hosts) can help to avoid interference with periodic network behavior,
   with randomness being a mandatory feature for avoiding correlation
   with network timing.

   Inferring the path performance between one measurement session or
   packet stream and other sessions/streams with alternate
   characteristics is generally discouraged with reactive paths because
   of the huge set of global parameters that have influence on
   instantaneous path performance.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live paths are relevant here as well.  See [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4656" title="&quot;A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)&quot;">RFC4656</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5357" title="&quot;A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)&quot;">RFC5357</a>].

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
   potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques
   that are within this scope of work.  Passive observations of user
   traffic for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.  We refer
   the reader to the privacy considerations described in the Large Scale
   Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework [<a href="#ref-LMAP" title="&quot;A framework for large-scale measurement platforms (LMAP)&quot;">LMAP</a>], which
   covers active and passive techniques.
