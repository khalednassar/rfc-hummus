Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
   multimedia telephony applications.  These applications are typically
   required to implement congestion control.  This document describes
   the test cases to be used in the performance evaluation of such
   congestion control algorithms in a controlled environment.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating congestion
   control algorithm proposals in controlled environments for real-time
   interactive media.  It is based on the guidelines enumerated in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8868" title="&quot;Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8868</a>] and the requirements discussed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8836" title="&quot;Congestion Control Requirements for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8836</a>].  The test
   cases cover basic usage scenarios and are described using a common
   structure, which allows for additional test cases to be added to
   those described herein to accommodate other topologies and/or the
   modeling of different path characteristics.  The described test cases
   in this memo should be used to evaluate any proposed congestion
   control algorithm for real-time interactive media.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Structure of Test Cases</span>

   All the test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
   implementers to describe a new test scenario without repeatedly
   explaining common attributes.  The structure includes a general
   description section that describes the test case and its motivation.
   Additionally the test case defines a set of attributes that
   characterize the testbed, for example, the network path between
   communicating peers and the diverse traffic sources.

   Define the test case:

      General description:  describes the motivation and the goals of
         the test case.

      Expected behavior:  describes the desired rate adaptation
         behavior.

      List of metrics to evaluate the desired behavior:  this indicates
         the minimum set of metrics (e.g., link utilization, media
         sending rate) that a proposed algorithm needs to measure to
         validate the expected rate adaptation behavior.  It should also
         indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over 10 ms, 100
         ms, or 1 s) for measuring certain metrics.  Typical measurement
         interval is 200 ms.

   Define testbed topology:

      Every test case needs to define an evaluation testbed topology.
      Figure 1 shows such an evaluation topology.  In this evaluation
      topology, S1..Sn are traffic sources.  These sources generate
      media traffic and use the congestion control algorithm(s) under
      investigation.  R1..Rn are the corresponding receivers.  A test
      case can have one or more such traffic sources (S) and their
      corresponding receivers (R).  The path from the source to
      destination is denoted as &quot;forward&quot;, and the path from a
      destination to a source is denoted as &quot;backward&quot;.  The following
      basic structure of the test case has been described from the
      perspective of media-generating endpoints attached on the left-
      hand side of Figure 1.  In this setup, the media flows are
      transported in the forward direction, and the corresponding
      feedback/control messages are transported in the backward
      direction.  However, it is also possible to set up the test with
      media in both forward and backward directions.  In that case,
      unless otherwise specified by the test case, it is expected that
      the backward path does not introduce any congestion-related
      impairments and has enough capacity to accommodate both media and
      feedback/control messages.  It should be noted that, depending on
      the test cases, it is possible to have different path
      characteristics in either of the directions.

                   Figure 1: Example of a Testbed Topology

      In a testbed environment with real equipment, there may exist a
      significant amount of unwanted traffic on the portions of the
      network path between the endpoints.  Some of this traffic may be
      generated by other processes on the endpoints themselves (e.g.,
      discovery protocols) or by other endpoints not presently under
      test.  Such unwanted traffic should be removed or avoided to the
      greatest extent possible.

   Define testbed attributes:

      Duration:  defines the duration of the test in seconds.

      Path characteristics:  defines the end-to-end transport level path
         characteristics of the testbed for a particular test case.  Two
         sets of attributes describe the path characteristics, one for
         the forward path and the other for the backward path.  The path
         characteristics for a particular path direction are applicable
         to all the sources &quot;S&quot; sending traffic on that path.  If only
         one attribute is specified, it is used for both path
         directions; however, unless specified the reverse path has no
         capacity restrictions and no path loss.

         Path direction:  forward or backward.

         Minimum bottleneck-link capacity:  defines the minimum capacity
            of the end-to-end path.

         Reference bottleneck capacity:  defines a reference value for
            the bottleneck capacity for test cases with time-varying
            bottleneck capacities.  All bottleneck capacities will be
            specified as a ratio with respect to the reference capacity
            value.

         One-way propagation delay:  describes the end-to-end latency
            along the path when network queues are empty, i.e., the time
            it takes for a packet to go from the sender to the receiver
            without encountering any queuing delay.

         Maximum end-to-end jitter:  defines the maximum jitter that can
            be observed along the path.

         Bottleneck queue type:  for example, &quot;tail drop&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7567" title="&quot;IETF Recommendations Regarding Active Queue Management&quot;">RFC7567</a>],
            Flow Queue Controlled Delay (FQ-CoDel) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8290" title="&quot;The Flow Queue CoDel Packet Scheduler and Active Queue Management Algorithm&quot;">RFC8290</a>], or
            Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8033" title="&quot;Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE): A Lightweight Control Scheme to Address the Bufferbloat Problem&quot;">RFC8033</a>].

         Bottleneck queue size:  defines the size of queue in terms of
            queuing time when the queue is full (in milliseconds).

         Path loss ratio:  characterizes the non-congested, additive
            losses to be generated on the end-to-end path.  This must
            describe the loss pattern or loss model used to generate the
            losses.

      Application-related:  defines the traffic source behavior for
         implementing the test case:

         Media traffic source:  defines the characteristics of the media
            sources.  When using more than one media source, the
            different attributes are enumerated separately for each
            different media source.

            Media type:  Video/Voice.

            Media flow direction:  forward, backward, or both.

            Number of media sources:  defines the total number of media
               sources.

            Media codec:  Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or Variable Bit Rate
               (VBR).

            Media source behavior:  describes the media encoder
               behavior.  It defines the main parameters that affect the
               adaptation behavior.  This may include but is not limited
               to the following:

               Adaptability:  describes the adaptation options.  For
                  example, in the case of video, it defines the
                  following ranges of adaptation: bit rate, frame rate,
                  and video resolution.  Similarly, in the case of
                  voice, it defines the range of bit rate adaptation,
                  the sampling rate variation, and the variation in
                  packetization interval.

               Output variation:  for a VBR encoder, it defines the
                  encoder output variation from the average target rate
                  over a particular measurement interval.  For example,
                  on average the encoder output may vary between 5% to
                  15% above or below the average target bit rate when
                  measured over a 100 ms time window.  The time interval
                  over which the variation is specified must be
                  provided.

               Responsiveness to a new bit rate request:  the lag in
                  time between a new bit rate request from the
                  congestion control algorithm and actual rate changes
                  in encoder output.  Depending on the encoder, this
                  value may be specified in absolute time (e.g., 10 ms
                  to 1000 ms) or other appropriate metric (e.g., next
                  frame interval time).

               More detailed discussions on expected media source
               behavior, including those from synthetic video traffic
               sources, can be found in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8593" title="&quot;Video Traffic Models for RTP Congestion Control Evaluations&quot;">RFC8593</a>].

            Media content:  describes the chosen video scenario.  For
               example, video test sequences are available at [<a href="#ref-xiph-seq" title="&quot;Video Test Media&quot;">xiph-seq</a>]
               and [<a href="#ref-HEVC-seq" title="&quot;Test Sequences&quot;">HEVC-seq</a>].  Different video scenarios give different
               distributions of video frames produced by the video
               encoder.  Hence, it is important to specify the media
               content used in a particular test.  If a synthetic video
               traffic source [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8593" title="&quot;Video Traffic Models for RTP Congestion Control Evaluations&quot;">RFC8593</a>] is used, then the synthetic
               video traffic source needs to be configured according to
               the characteristics of the media content specified.

            Media timeline:  describes the point when the media source
               is introduced and removed from the testbed.  For example,
               the media source may start transmitting immediately when
               the test case begins, or after a few seconds.

            Startup behavior:  the media starts at a defined bit rate,
               which may be the minimum, maximum bit rate, or a value in
               between (in Kbps).

         Competing traffic source:  describes the characteristics of the
            competing traffic source, the different types of competing
            flows are enumerated in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8868" title="&quot;Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8868</a>].

            Traffic direction:  forward, backward, or both.

            Type of sources:  defines the types of competing traffic
               sources.  Types of competing traffic flows are listed in
               [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8868" title="&quot;Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8868</a>].  For example, the number of TCP flows
               connected to a web browser, the mean size and
               distribution of the content downloaded.

            Number of sources:  defines the total number of competing
               sources of each media type per traffic direction.

            Congestion control:  enumerates the congestion control used
               by each type of competing traffic.

            Traffic timeline:  describes when the competing traffic
               starts and ends in the test case.

      Additional attributes:  describes attributes essential for
         implementing a test case that are not included in the above
         structure.  These attributes must be well defined, so that the
         other implementers of that particular test case are able to
         implement it easily.

   Any attribute can have a set of values (enclosed within &quot;[]&quot;).  Each
   member value of such a set must be treated as different value for the
   same attribute.  It is desired to run separate tests for each such
   attribute value.

   The test cases described in this document follow the above structure.

   This section describes recommended test case settings and could be
   overwritten by the respective test cases.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Evaluation Metrics</span>

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms, the
   implementers must log enough information to visualize the following
   metrics at a fine enough time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       A.  End-to-end delay for the congestion-controlled media flow(s).
           For example, end-to-end delay observed on the IP packet level
           and the video frame level.

       B.  Variation in sending bit rate and throughput.  Mainly
           observing the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

       C.  Packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       D.  Feedback message overhead.

       E.  Convergence time.  Time to reach steady state for the
           congestion-controlled media flow(s).  Each occurrence of
           convergence during the test period needs to be presented.

   2.  Transport level:

       A.  Bandwidth utilization.

       B.  Queue length (milliseconds at specified path capacity).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Path Characteristics</span>

   Each path between a sender and receiver as described in Figure 1 has
   the following characteristics unless otherwise specified in the test
   case:

   Path direction:  forward and backward.

   Reference bottleneck capacity:  1 Mbps.

   One-way propagation delay:  50 ms.  Implementers are encouraged to
      run the experiment with additional propagation delays mentioned in
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8868" title="&quot;Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8868</a>].

   Maximum end-to-end jitter:  30 ms.  Jitter models are described in
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8868" title="&quot;Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8868</a>].

   Bottleneck queue type:  &quot;tail drop&quot;.  Implementers are encouraged to
      run the experiment with other Active Queue Management (AQM)
      schemes, such as FQ-CoDel and PIE.

   Bottleneck queue size:  300 ms.

   Path loss ratio:  0%.

   Examples of additional network parameters are discussed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8868" title="&quot;Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8868</a>].

   For test cases involving time-varying bottleneck capacity, all
   capacity values are specified as a ratio with respect to a reference
   capacity value, so as to allow flexible scaling of capacity values
   along with media source rate range.  There exist two different
   mechanisms for inducing path capacity variation: a) by explicitly
   modifying the value of physical link capacity, or b) by introducing
   background non-adaptive UDP traffic with time-varying traffic rate.
   Implementers are encouraged to run the experiments with both
   mechanisms for test cases specified in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>, <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>, and
   <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Media Source</span>

   Unless otherwise specified, each test case will include one or more
   media sources as described below:

   Media type:  Video

      Media codec:  VBR

      Media source behavior:

         Adaptability:

            Bit rate range:  150 Kbps - 1.5 Mbps.  In real-life
               applications, the bit rate range can vary a lot depending
               on the provided service; for example, the maximum bit
               rate can be up to 4 Mbps.  However, for running tests to
               evaluate the congestion control algorithms, it is more
               important to have a look at how they react to a certain
               amount of bandwidth change.  Also it is possible that the
               media traffic generator used in a particular simulator or
               testbed is not capable of generating a higher bit rate.
               Hence, we have selected a suitable bit rate range typical
               of consumer-grade video conferencing applications in
               designing the test case.  If a different bit rate range
               is used in the test cases, then the end-to-end path
               capacity values will also need to be scaled accordingly.

            Frame resolution:  144p - 720p (or 1080p).  This resolution
               range is selected based on the bit rate range.  If a
               different bit rate range is used in the test cases, then
               a suitable frame resolution range also needs to be
               selected.

            Frame rate:  10 fps - 30 fps.  This frame rate range is
               selected based on the bit rate range.  If a different bit
               rate range is used in the test cases, then the frame rate
               range also needs to be suitably adjusted.

         Variation from target bit rate:  +/-5%. Unless otherwise
            specified in the test case(s), bit rate variation should be
            calculated over a one (1) second period of time.

         Responsiveness to new bit rate request:  100 ms

      Media content:  The media content should represent a typical video
         conversational scenario with head and shoulder movement.  We
         recommend using the Foreman video sequence [<a href="#ref-xiph-seq" title="&quot;Video Test Media&quot;">xiph-seq</a>].

      Media startup behavior:  150 Kbps.  It should be noted that
         applications can use smart ways to select an optimal startup
         bit rate value for a certain network condition.  In such cases,
         the candidate proposals may show the effectiveness of such a
         smart approach as additional information for the evaluation
         process.

   Media type:  Audio

      Media codec:  CBR

      Media bit rate:  20 Kbps

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Variable Available Capacity with a Single Flow</span>

   In this test case, the minimum bottleneck-link capacity between the
   two endpoints varies over time.  This test is designed to measure the
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.  This test tries to
   address the requirements in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8836" title="&quot;Congestion Control Requirements for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8836</a>], which requires the algorithm
   to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower end-to-end latency when there
   exists:

   *  an intermediate bottleneck

   *  change in available capacity (e.g., due to interface change,
      routing change, abrupt arrival/departure of background non-
      adaptive traffic)

   *  maximum media bit rate is greater than link capacity.  In this
      case, when the application tries to ramp up to its maximum bit
      rate, since the link capacity is limited to a lower value, the
      congestion control scheme is expected to stabilize the sending bit
      rate close to the available bottleneck capacity.

   It should be noted that the exact variation in available capacity due
   to any of the above depends on the underlying technologies.  Hence,
   we describe a set of known factors, which may be extended to devise a
   more specific test case targeting certain behaviors in a certain
   network environment.

   Expected behavior:  The candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
      path capacity constraint, converge to the bottleneck link&#x27;s
      capacity, and adapt the flow to avoid unwanted media rate
      oscillation when the sending bit rate is approaching the
      bottleneck link&#x27;s capacity.  Such oscillations might occur when
      the media flow(s) attempts to reach its maximum bit rate but
      overshoots the usage of the available bottleneck capacity, then to
      rectify, it reduces the bit rate and starts to ramp up again.

   Evaluation metrics:  As described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   Testbed topology:  One media source S1 is connected to the
      corresponding R1.  The media traffic is transported over the
      forward path and corresponding feedback/control traffic is
      transported over the backward path.

      This test uses bottleneck path capacity variation as listed in
      Table 1.

      When using background non-adaptive UDP traffic to induce a time-
      varying bottleneck, the physical path capacity remains at 4 Mbps,
      and the UDP traffic source rate changes over time as (4 - (Y x
      r)), where r is the Reference bottleneck capacity in Mbps, and Y
      is the path capacity ratio specified in Table 1.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Variable Available Capacity with Multiple Flows</span>

   This test case is similar to <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.  However, this test will
   also consider persistent network load due to competing traffic.

   Expected behavior:  The candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
      variation in available capacity and adapt the media stream(s)
      accordingly.  The flows stabilize around their maximum bit rate as
      the maximum link capacity is large enough to accommodate the
      flows.  When the available capacity drops, the flows adapt by
      decreasing their sending bit rate, and when congestion disappears,
      the flows are again expected to ramp up.

   Evaluation metrics:  As described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   Testbed topology:  Two (2) media sources S1 and S2 are connected to
      their corresponding destinations R1 and R2.  The media traffic is
      transported over the forward path and corresponding feedback/
      control traffic is transported over the backward path.

   Testbed attributes:  Testbed attributes are similar to those
      described in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>, except for the test-specific capacity
      variation setup.

   Test-specific information:  This test uses path capacity variation as
      listed in Table 2 with a corresponding end time of 125 seconds.
      The reference bottleneck capacity is 2 Mbps.  When using
      background non-adaptive UDP traffic to induce time-varying
      bottleneck for congestion-controlled media flows, the physical
      path capacity is 4 Mbps, and the UDP traffic source rate changes
      over time as (4 - (Y x r)), where r is the Reference bottleneck
      capacity in Mbps, and Y is the path capacity ratio specified in
      Table 2.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Congested Feedback Link with Bi-directional Media Flows</span>

   Real-time interactive media uses RTP; hence it is assumed that RTCP,
   RTP header extension, or such would be used by the congestion control
   algorithm in the back channel.  Due to the asymmetric nature of the
   link between communicating peers, it is possible for a participating
   peer to not receive such feedback information due to an impaired or
   congested back channel (even when the forward channel might not be
   impaired).  This test case is designed to observe the candidate
   congestion control behavior in such an event.

   Expected behavior:  It is expected that the candidate algorithms are
      able to cope with the lack of feedback information and to adapt to
      minimize the performance degradation of media flows in the forward
      channel.

      It should be noted that for this test case, logs are compared with
      the reference case, i.e., when the backward channel has no
      impairments.

   Evaluation metrics:  As described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   Testbed topology:  One (1) media source S1 is connected to
      corresponding R1, but both endpoints are additionally receiving
      and sending data, respectively.  The media traffic (S1-&gt;R1) is
      transported over the forward path, and the corresponding feedback/
      control traffic is transported over the backward path.  Likewise,
      media traffic (S2-&gt;R2) is transported over the backward path, and
      the corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
      forward path.

      background non-adaptive UDP traffic to induce a time-varying
      bottleneck for congestion-controlled media flows, the physical
      path capacity is 4 Mbps for both directions, and the UDP traffic
      source rate changes over time as (4-x) Mbps in each direction,

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.4" href="#section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Competing Media Flows with the Same Congestion Control Algorithm</span>

   In this test case, more than one media flow share the bottleneck
   link, and each of them uses the same congestion control algorithm.
   This is a typical scenario where a real-time interactive application
   sends more than one media flow to the same destination, and these
   flows are multiplexed over the same port.  In such a scenario, it is
   likely that the flows will be routed via the same path and need to
   share the available bandwidth amongst themselves.  For the sake of
   simplicity, it is assumed that there are no other competing traffic
   sources in the bottleneck link and that there is sufficient capacity
   to accommodate all the flows individually.  While this appears to be
   a variant of the test case defined in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>, it focuses on the
   capacity-sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm.  The previous
   test case, on the other hand, measures adaptability, stability, and
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.

   Expected behavior:  It is expected that the competing flows will
      converge to an optimum bit rate to accommodate all the flows with
      minimum possible latency and loss.  Specifically, the test
      introduces three media flows at different time instances.  When
      the second flow appears, there should still be room to accommodate
      another flow on the bottleneck link.  Lastly, when the third flow
      appears, the bottleneck link should be saturated.

   Evaluation metrics:  As described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   Testbed topology:  Three media sources S1, S2, and S3 are connected
      to R1, R2, and R3, respectively.  The media traffic is transported
      over the forward path, and the corresponding feedback/control
      traffic is transported over the backward path.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.5" href="#section-5.5">5.5</a>.  Round Trip Time Fairness</span>

   In this test case, multiple media flows share the bottleneck link,
   but the one-way propagation delay for each flow is different.  For
   the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that there are no other
   competing traffic sources in the bottleneck link and that there is
   sufficient capacity to accommodate all the flows.  While this appears
   to be a variant of test case 5.2 (<a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>), it focuses on the
   capacity-sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm under different
   RTTs.

   Expected behavior:  It is expected that the competing flows will
      converge to bit rates to accommodate all the flows with minimum
      possible latency and loss.  The effectiveness of the algorithm
      depends on how fast and fairly the competing flows converge to
      their steady states irrespective of the RTT observed.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.6" href="#section-5.6">5.6</a>.  Media Flow Competing with a Long TCP Flow</span>

   In this test case, one or more media flows share the bottleneck link
   with at least one long-lived TCP flow.  Long-lived TCP flows download
   data throughout the session and are expected to have infinite amount
   of data to send and receive.  This is a scenario where a multimedia
   application coexists with a large file download.  The test case
   measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to competing
   traffic.  It addresses requirement 3 in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8836#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of [RFC8836]</a>.

   Expected behavior:  Depending on the convergence observed in test
      cases 5.1 and 5.2, the candidate algorithm may be able to avoid
      congestion collapse.  In the worst case, the media stream will
      fall to the minimum media bit rate.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.7" href="#section-5.7">5.7</a>.  Media Flow Competing with Short TCP Flows</span>

   In this test case, one or more congestion-controlled media flows
   share the bottleneck link with multiple short-lived TCP flows.
   Short-lived TCP flows resemble the on/off pattern observed in web
   traffic, wherein clients (for example, browsers) connect to a server
   and download a resource (typically a web page, few images, text
   files, etc.) using several TCP connections.  This scenario shows the
   performance of a multimedia application when several browser windows
   are active.  The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate
   algorithm to competing web traffic, and it addresses requirement 1.E
   in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8836#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of [RFC8836]</a>.

   Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross traffic either
   appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long-lived TCP flow.
   The intention of this test is to observe the impact of a short-term
   burst on the behavior of the candidate algorithm.

   Expected behavior:  The candidate algorithm is expected to avoid flow
      starvation during the presence of short and bursty competing TCP
      flows, streaming at least at the minimum media bit rate.  After
      competing TCP flows terminate, the media streams are expected to
      be robust enough to eventually recover to previous steady state
      behavior, and at the very least, avoid persistent starvation.

   Evaluation metrics:  Includes the following metrics in addition to
      those described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>:

      1.  Flow level:

          A.  Variation in the sending rate of the TCP flow

          B.  TCP throughput

   Testbed topology:  The topology described here is the same as the one
      described in Figure 6.

            Congestion algorithm:  default TCP congestion control
               [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5681" title="&quot;TCP Congestion Control&quot;">RFC5681</a>].  Implementers are also encouraged to run the
               experiment with an alternative TCP congestion control
               algorithm.

            Traffic timeline:  Each short TCP flow is modeled as a
               sequence of file downloads interleaved with idle periods.
               Not all short TCP flows start at the same time, two of
               them start in the ON state, while rest of the eight flows
               start in an OFF state.  For a description of the short
               TCP flow model, see test-specific information below.

   Test-specific information:

      Short TCP traffic model:  The short TCP model to be used in this
         test is described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8868" title="&quot;Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Media&quot;">RFC8868</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.8" href="#section-5.8">5.8</a>.  Media Pause and Resume</span>

   In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flow
   share the link bandwidth, and all flows reach to a steady state by
   utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way.  At this stage, one of
   the media flows is paused for a moment.  This event will result in
   more available bandwidth for the rest of the flows as they are on a
   shared link.  When the paused media flow resumes, it no longer has
   the same bandwidth share on the link.  It has to make its way through
   the other existing flows in the link to achieve a fair share of the
   link capacity.  This test case is important specially for real-time
   interactive media, which consists of more than one media flows and
   can pause/resume media flows at any point of time during the session.
   This test case directly addresses requirement 5 in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8836#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of
   [RFC8836]</a>.  One can think of it as a variation of the test case
   defined in <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>.  However, it is different as the candidate
   algorithms can use different strategies to increase efficiency, for
   example, in terms of fairness, convergence time, oscillation
   reduction, etc., by capitalizing on the fact that they have previous
   information of the link.

   Expected behavior:  During the period where the third stream is
      paused, the two remaining flows are expected to increase their
      rates and reach the maximum media bit rate.  When the third stream
      resumes, all three flows are expected to converge to the same
      original fair share of rates prior to the media pause/resume
      event.

   Evaluation metrics:  Includes the following metrics in addition to
      those described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>:

      1.  Flow level:

          A.  Variation in sending bit rate and throughput.  Mainly
              observing the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

   Testbed topology:  Same as the test case defined in <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>.

   Testbed attributes:  The general description of the testbed
      parameters are the same as <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a> with changes in the test-
      specific setup as below:

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Other Potential Test Cases</span>

   It has been noticed that there are other interesting test cases
   besides the basic test cases listed above.  In many aspects, these
   additional test cases can help further evaluation of the candidate
   algorithm.  They are listed below.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Media Flows with Priority</span>

   In this test case, media flows will have different priority levels.
   This is an extension of <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a> where the same test is run with
   different priority levels imposed on each of the media flows.  For
   example, the first flow (S1) is assigned a priority of 2, whereas the
   remaining two flows (S2 and S3) are assigned a priority of 1.  The
   candidate algorithm must reflect the relative priorities assigned to
   each media flow.  In this case, the first flow (S1) must arrive at a
   steady-state rate approximately twice that of the other two flows (S2
   and S3).

   The candidate algorithm can use a coupled congestion control
   mechanism [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8699" title="&quot;Coupled Congestion Control for RTP Media&quot;">RFC8699</a>] or use a weighted priority scheduler for the
   bandwidth distribution according to the respective media flow
   priority or use.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Explicit Congestion Notification Usage</span>

   This test case requires running all the basic test cases with the
   availability of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6679" title="&quot;Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) for RTP over UDP&quot;">RFC6679</a>]
   feature enabled.  The goal of this test is to exhibit that the
   candidate algorithms do not fail when ECN signals are available.
   With ECN signals enabled, the algorithms are expected to perform
   better than their delay-based variants.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.3" href="#section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Multiple Bottlenecks</span>

   In this test case, one congestion-controlled media flow, S1-&gt;R1,
   traverses a path with multiple bottlenecks.  As illustrated in
   Figure 7, the first flow (S1-&gt;R1) competes with the second
   congestion-controlled media flow (S2-&gt;R2) over the link between A and
   B, which is close to the sender side.  Again, that flow (S1-&gt;R1)
   competes with the third congestion-controlled media flow (S3-&gt;R3)
   over the link between C and D, which is close to the receiver side.
   The goal of this test is to ensure that the candidate algorithms work
   properly in the presence of multiple bottleneck links on the end-to-
   end path.

   Expected behavior:  The candidate algorithm is expected to achieve
      full utilization at both bottleneck links without starving any of
      the three congestion-controlled media flows and ensuring fair
      share of the available bandwidth at each bottleneck.
