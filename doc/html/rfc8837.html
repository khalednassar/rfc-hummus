Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) Packet Markings for WebRTC QoS

Abstract

   Networks can provide different forwarding treatments for individual
   packets based on Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) values on
   a per-hop basis.  This document provides the recommended DSCP values
   for web browsers to use for various classes of Web Real-Time
   Communication (WebRTC) traffic.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2474" title="&quot;Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers&quot;">RFC2474</a>] packet marking
   can help provide QoS in some environments.  This specification
   provides default packet marking for browsers that support WebRTC
   applications, but does not change any advice or requirements in other
   RFCs.  The contents of this specification are intended to be a simple
   set of implementation recommendations based on previous RFCs.

   Networks in which these DSCP markings are beneficial (likely to
   improve QoS for WebRTC traffic) include:

   1.  Private, wide-area networks.  Network administrators have control
       over remarking packets and treatment of packets.

   2.  Residential Networks.  If the congested link is the broadband
       uplink in a cable or DSL scenario, residential routers/NAT often
       support preferential treatment based on DSCP.

   3.  Wireless Networks.  If the congested link is a local wireless
       network, marking may help.

   There are cases where these DSCP markings do not help but, aside from
   possible priority inversion for &quot;Less-than-Best-Effort traffic&quot; (see
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), they seldom make things worse if packets are marked
   appropriately.

   DSCP values are, in principle, site specific with each site selecting
   its own code points for controlling per-hop behavior to influence the
   QoS for transport-layer flows.  However, in the WebRTC use cases, the
   browsers need to set them to something when there is no site-specific
   information.  This document describes a subset of DSCP code point
   values drawn from existing RFCs and common usage for use with WebRTC
   applications.  These code points are intended to be the default
   values used by a WebRTC application.  While other values could be
   used, using a non-default value may result in unexpected per-hop
   behavior.  It is RECOMMENDED that WebRTC applications use non-default
   values only in private networks that are configured to use different
   values.

   This specification defines inputs that are provided by the WebRTC
   application hosted in the browser that aid the browser in determining
   how to set the various packet markings.  The specification also
   defines the mapping from abstract QoS policies (flow type, priority
   level) to those packet markings.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms &quot;browser&quot; and &quot;non-browser&quot; are defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7742" title="&quot;WebRTC Video Processing and Codec Requirements&quot;">RFC7742</a>] and
   carry the same meaning in this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Relation to Other Specifications</span>

   This document is a complement to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7657" title="&quot;Differentiated Services (Diffserv) and Real-Time Communication&quot;">RFC7657</a>], which describes the
   interaction between DSCP and real-time communications.  That RFC
   covers the implications of using various DSCP values, particularly
   focusing on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3550" title="&quot;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications&quot;">RFC3550</a>] streams
   that are multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow.

   There are a number of guidelines specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7657" title="&quot;Differentiated Services (Diffserv) and Real-Time Communication&quot;">RFC7657</a>] that apply to
   marking traffic sent by WebRTC applications, as it is common for
   multiple RTP streams to be multiplexed on the same transport-layer
   flow.  Generally, the RTP streams would be marked with a value as
   appropriate from Table 1.  A WebRTC application might also multiplex
   data channel [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8831" title="&quot;WebRTC Data Channels&quot;">RFC8831</a>] traffic over the same 5-tuple as RTP streams,
   which would also be marked per that table.  The guidance in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7657" title="&quot;Differentiated Services (Diffserv) and Real-Time Communication&quot;">RFC7657</a>]
   says that all data channel traffic would be marked with a single
   value that is typically different from the value(s) used for RTP
   streams multiplexed with the data channel traffic over the same
   5-tuple, assuming RTP streams are marked with a value other than
   Default Forwarding (DF).  This is expanded upon further in the next
   section.

   This specification does not change or override the advice in any
   other RFCs about setting packet markings.  Rather, it simply selects
   a subset of DSCP values that is relevant in the WebRTC context.

   The DSCP value set by the endpoint is not trusted by the network.  In
   addition, the DSCP value may be remarked at any place in the network
   for a variety of reasons to any other DSCP value, including the DF
   value to provide basic best-effort service.  Even so, there is a
   benefit to marking traffic even if it only benefits the first few
   hops.  The implications are discussed in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7657#section-3.2">Section&nbsp;3.2 of [RFC7657]</a>.
   Further, a mitigation for such action is through an authorization
   mechanism.  Such an authorization mechanism is outside the scope of
   this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Inputs</span>

   This document recommends DSCP values for two classes of WebRTC flows:

   *  media flows that are RTP streams [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8834" title="&quot;Media Transport and Use of RTP in WebRTC&quot;">RFC8834</a>]

   *  data flows that are data channels [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8831" title="&quot;WebRTC Data Channels&quot;">RFC8831</a>]

   Each of the RTP streams and distinct data channels consist of all of
   the packets associated with an independent media entity, so an RTP
   stream or distinct data channel is not always equivalent to a
   transport-layer flow defined by a 5-tuple (source address,
   destination address, source port, destination port, and protocol).
   There may be multiple RTP streams and data channels multiplexed over
   the same 5-tuple, with each having a different level of importance to
   the application and, therefore, potentially marked using different
   DSCP values than another RTP stream or data channel within the same
   transport-layer flow.  (Note that there are restrictions with respect
   to marking different data channels carried within the same Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) association as outlined in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.)

   The following are the inputs provided by the WebRTC application to
   the browser:

   *  Flow Type: The application provides this input because it knows if
      the flow is audio, interactive video ([<a href="/doc/html/rfc4594" title="&quot;Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes&quot;">RFC4594</a>] [<a href="#ref-G.1010" title="&quot;End-user multimedia QoS categories&quot;">G.1010</a>]) with or
      without audio, or data.

   *  Application Priority: Another input is the relative importance of
      an RTP stream or data channel.  Many applications have multiple
      flows of the same flow type and some flows are often more
      important than others.  For example, in a video conference where
      there are usually audio and video flows, the audio flow may be
      more important than the video flow.  JavaScript applications can
      tell the browser whether a particular flow is of High, Medium,
      Low, or Very Low importance to the application.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8835">RFC8835</a>] defines in more detail what an individual flow is within
   the WebRTC context and priorities for media and data flows.

   Currently in WebRTC, media sent over RTP is assumed to be interactive
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8835" title="&quot;Transports for WebRTC&quot;">RFC8835</a>] and browser APIs do not exist to allow an application to
   differentiate between interactive and non-interactive video.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  DSCP Mappings</span>

   The DSCP values for each flow type of interest to WebRTC based on
   application priority are shown in Table 1.  These values are based on
   the framework and recommended values in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4594" title="&quot;Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes&quot;">RFC4594</a>].  A web browser
   SHOULD use these values to mark the appropriate media packets.  More
   information on Expedited Forwarding (EF) and Assured Forwarding (AF)
   can be found in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3246" title="&quot;An Expedited Forwarding PHB (Per-Hop Behavior)&quot;">RFC3246</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2597" title="&quot;Assured Forwarding PHB Group&quot;">RFC2597</a>], respectively.  DF is Default
   Forwarding, which provides the basic best-effort service [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2474" title="&quot;Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers&quot;">RFC2474</a>].

   WebRTC&#x27;s use of multiple DSCP values may result in packets with
   certain DSCP values being blocked by a network.  See <a href="/doc/html/rfc8835#section-4.2">Section&nbsp;4.2 of
   [RFC8835]</a> for further discussion, including how WebRTC
   implementations establish and maintain connectivity when such
   blocking is encountered.

         Table 1: Recommended DSCP Values for WebRTC Applications

   The application priority, indicated by the columns &quot;Very Low&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;,
   &quot;Medium&quot;, and &quot;High&quot;, signifies the relative importance of the flow
   within the application.  It is an input that the browser receives to
   assist in selecting the DSCP value and adjusting the network
   transport behavior.

   The above table assumes that packets marked with LE are treated as
   lower effort (i.e., &quot;less than best effort&quot;), such as the LE behavior
   described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8622" title="&quot;A Lower-Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB) for Differentiated Services&quot;">RFC8622</a>].  However, the treatment of LE is
   implementation dependent.  If an implementation treats LE as other
   than &quot;less than best effort&quot;, then the actual priority (or, more
   precisely, the per-hop behavior) of the packets may be changed from
   what is intended.  It is common for LE to be treated the same as DF,
   so applications and browsers using LE cannot assume that LE will be
   treated differently than DF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7657" title="&quot;Differentiated Services (Diffserv) and Real-Time Communication&quot;">RFC7657</a>].  During development of this
   document, the CS1 DSCP was recommended for &quot;very low&quot; application
   priority traffic; implementations that followed that recommendation
   SHOULD be updated to use the LE DSCP instead of the CS1 DSCP.

   Implementers should also note that excess EF traffic is dropped.
   This could mean that a packet marked as EF may not get through,
   although the same packet marked with a different DSCP value would
   have gotten through.  This is not a flaw, but how excess EF traffic
   is intended to be treated.

   The browser SHOULD first select the flow type of the flow.  Within
   the flow type, the relative importance of the flow SHOULD be used to
   select the appropriate DSCP value.

   Currently, all WebRTC video is assumed to be interactive [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8835" title="&quot;Transports for WebRTC&quot;">RFC8835</a>],
   for which the interactive video DSCP values in Table 1 SHOULD be
   used.  Browsers MUST NOT use the AF3x DSCP values (for non-
   interactive video in Table 1) for WebRTC applications.  Non-browser
   implementations of WebRTC MAY use the AF3x DSCP values for video that
   is known not to be interactive, e.g., all video in a WebRTC video
   playback application that is not implemented in a browser.

   The combination of flow type and application priority provides
   specificity and helps in selecting the right DSCP value for the flow.
   All packets within a flow SHOULD have the same application priority.
   In some cases, the selected application priority cell may have
   multiple DSCP values, such as AF41 and AF42.  These offer different
   drop precedences.  The different drop precedence values provide
   additional granularity in classifying packets within a flow.  For
   example, in a video conference, the video flow may have medium
   application priority, thus either AF42 or AF43 may be selected.  More
   important video packets (e.g., a video picture or frame encoded
   without any dependency on any prior pictures or frames) might be
   marked with AF42 and less important packets (e.g., a video picture or
   frame encoded based on the content of one or more prior pictures or
   frames) might be marked with AF43 (e.g., receipt of the more
   important packets enables a video renderer to continue after one or
   more packets are lost).

   It is worth noting that the application priority is utilized by the
   coupled congestion control mechanism for media flows per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8699" title="&quot;Coupled Congestion Control for RTP Media&quot;">RFC8699</a>]
   and the SCTP scheduler for data channel traffic per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8831" title="&quot;WebRTC Data Channels&quot;">RFC8831</a>].

   For reasons discussed in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7657#section-6">Section&nbsp;6 of [RFC7657]</a>, if multiple flows
   are multiplexed using a reliable transport (e.g., TCP), then all of
   the packets for all flows multiplexed over that transport-layer flow
   MUST be marked using the same DSCP value.  Likewise, all WebRTC data
   channel packets transmitted over an SCTP association MUST be marked
   using the same DSCP value, regardless of how many data channels
   (streams) exist or what kind of traffic is carried over the various
   SCTP streams.  In the event that the browser wishes to change the
   DSCP value in use for an SCTP association, it MUST reset the SCTP
   congestion controller after changing values.  However, frequent
   changes in the DSCP value used for an SCTP association are
   discouraged, as this would defeat any attempts at effectively
   managing congestion.  It should also be noted that any change in DSCP
   value that results in a reset of the congestion controller puts the
   SCTP association back into slow start, which may have undesirable
   effects on application performance.

   For the data channel traffic multiplexed over an SCTP association, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the DSCP value selected be the one associated
   with the highest priority requested for all data channels multiplexed
   over the SCTP association.  Likewise, when multiplexing multiple
   flows over a TCP connection, the DSCP value selected SHOULD be the
   one associated with the highest priority requested for all
   multiplexed flows.

   If a packet enters a network that has no support for a flow-type-
   application priority combination specified in Table 1, then the
   network node at the edge will remark the DSCP value based on
   policies.  This could result in the flow not getting the network
   treatment it expects based on the original DSCP value in the packet.
   Subsequently, if the packet enters a network that supports a larger
   number of these combinations, there may not be sufficient information
   in the packet to restore the original markings.  Mechanisms for
   restoring such original DSCP is outside the scope of this document.

   In summary, DSCP marking provides neither guarantees nor promised
   levels of service.  However, DSCP marking is expected to provide a
   statistical improvement in real-time service as a whole.  The service
   provided to a packet is dependent upon the network design along the
   path, as well as the network conditions at every hop.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Since the JavaScript application specifies the flow type and
   application priority that determine the media flow DSCP values used
   by the browser, the browser could consider application use of a large
   number of higher priority flows to be suspicious.  If the server
   hosting the JavaScript application is compromised, many browsers
   within the network might simultaneously transmit flows with the same
   DSCP marking.  The Diffserv architecture requires ingress traffic
   conditioning for reasons that include protecting the network from
   this sort of attack.

   Otherwise, this specification does not add any additional security
   implications beyond those addressed in the following DSCP-related
   specifications.  For security implications on use of DSCP, please
   refer to <a href="/doc/html/rfc7657#section-7">Section&nbsp;7 of [RFC7657]</a> and <a href="/doc/html/rfc4594#section-6">Section&nbsp;6 of [RFC4594]</a>.  Please
   also see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8826" title="&quot;Security Considerations for WebRTC&quot;">RFC8826</a>] as an additional reference.

   This document has no IANA actions.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Downward References</span>

   This specification contains downwards references to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4594" title="&quot;Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes&quot;">RFC4594</a>] and
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7657" title="&quot;Differentiated Services (Diffserv) and Real-Time Communication&quot;">RFC7657</a>].  However, the parts of the former RFCs used by this
   specification are sufficiently stable for these downward references.
   The guidance in the latter RFC is necessary to understand the
   Diffserv technology used in this document and the motivation for the
   recommended DSCP values and procedures.
