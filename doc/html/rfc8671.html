Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) only defines access to the Adj-RIB-
   In Routing Information Bases (RIBs).  This document updates BMP (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7854">RFC</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7854">7854</a>) by adding access to the Adj-RIB-Out RIBs.  It also adds a new
   flag to the peer header to distinguish between Adj-RIB-In and Adj-
   RIB-Out.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines monitoring of the received
   (e.g., Adj-RIB-In) Routing Information Bases (RIBs) per peer.  The
   pre-policy Adj-RIB-In conveys to a BMP receiver all RIB data before
   any policy has been applied.  The post-policy Adj-RIB-In conveys to a
   BMP receiver all RIB data after policy filters and/or modifications
   have been applied.  An example of pre-policy versus post-policy is
   when an inbound policy applies attribute modification or filters.
   Pre-policy would contain information prior to the inbound policy
   changes or filters of data.  Post-policy would convey the changed
   data or would not contain the filtered data.

   Monitoring the received updates that the router received before any
   policy has been applied is the primary level of monitoring for most
   use cases.  Inbound policy validation and auditing are the primary
   use cases for enabling post-policy monitoring.

   In order for a BMP receiver to receive any BGP data, the BMP sender
   (e.g., router) needs to have an established BGP peering session and
   actively be receiving updates for an Adj-RIB-In.

   Being able to only monitor the Adj-RIB-In puts a restriction on what
   data is available to BMP receivers via BMP senders (e.g., routers).
   This is an issue when the receiving end of the BGP peer is not
   enabled for BMP or when it is not accessible for administrative
   reasons.  For example, a service provider advertises prefixes to a
   customer, but the service provider cannot see what it advertises via
   BMP.  Asking the customer to enable BMP and monitoring of the Adj-
   RIB-In are not feasible.

   BMP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7854" title="&quot;BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)&quot;">RFC7854</a>] only defines Adj-RIB-In being sent to BMP receivers.
   This document updates the per-peer header defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7854#section-4.2">Section&nbsp;4.2 of
   [RFC7854]</a> by adding a new flag to distinguish between Adj-RIB-In and
   Adj-RIB-Out. BMP senders use the new flag to send either Adj-RIB-In
   or Adj-RIB-Out.

   Adding Adj-RIB-Out provides the ability for a BMP sender to send to
   BMP receivers what it advertises to BGP peers, which can be used for
   outbound policy validation and to monitor routes that were
   advertised.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Definitions</span>

   Adj-RIB-Out
      As defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4271" title="&quot;A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)&quot;">RFC4271</a>], &quot;The Adj-RIBs-Out contains the routes for
      advertisement to specific peers by means of the local speaker&#x27;s
      UPDATE messages.&quot;

   Pre-policy Adj-RIB-Out
      The result before applying the outbound policy to an Adj-RIB-Out.
      This normally would match what is in the local RIB.

   Post-policy Adj-RIB-Out
      The result of applying outbound policy to an Adj-RIB-Out. This
      MUST convey to the BMP receiver what is actually transmitted to
      the peer.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Per-Peer Header</span>

   The per-peer header has the same structure and flags as defined in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7854#section-4.2">Section&nbsp;4.2 of [RFC7854]</a> with the addition of the O flag as shown
   here:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |V|L|A|O| Resv  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   *  The O flag indicates Adj-RIB-In if set to 0 and Adj-RIB-Out if set
      to 1.

   The existing flags are defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7854#section-4.2">Section&nbsp;4.2 of [RFC7854]</a>, and the
   remaining bits are reserved for future use.  They MUST be transmitted
   as 0, and their values MUST be ignored on receipt.

   When the O flag is set to 1, the following fields in the per-peer
   header are redefined:

   *  Peer Address: The remote IP address associated with the TCP
      session over which the encapsulated Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is
      sent.

   *  Peer AS: The Autonomous System number of the peer to which the
      encapsulated PDU is sent.

   *  Peer BGP ID: The BGP Identifier of the peer to which the
      encapsulated PDU is sent.

   *  Timestamp: The time when the encapsulated routes were advertised
      (one may also think of this as the time when they were installed
      in the Adj-RIB-Out), expressed in seconds and microseconds since
      midnight (zero hour), January 1, 1970 (UTC).  If zero, the time is
      unavailable.  Precision of the timestamp is implementation-
      dependent.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Adj-RIB-Out</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Post-policy</span>

   The primary use case in monitoring Adj-RIB-Out is to monitor the
   updates transmitted to a BGP peer after outbound policy has been
   applied.  These updates reflect the result after modifications and
   filters have been applied (e.g., post-policy Adj-RIB-Out).  Some
   attributes are set when the BGP message is transmitted, such as next
   hop.  Post-policy Adj-RIB-Out MUST convey to the BMP receiver what is
   actually transmitted to the peer.

   The L flag MUST be set to 1 to indicate post-policy.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Pre-policy</span>

   Similar to Adj-RIB-In policy validation, pre-policy Adj-RIB-Out can
   be used to validate and audit outbound policies.  For example, a
   comparison between pre-policy and post-policy can be used to validate
   the outbound policy.

   Depending on the BGP peering session type -- Internal BGP (IBGP),
   IBGP route reflector client, External BGP (EBGP), BGP confederations,
   route server client -- the candidate routes that make up the pre-
   policy Adj-RIB-Out do not contain all local RIB routes.  Pre-policy
   Adj-RIB-Out conveys only routes that are available based on the
   peering type.  Post-policy represents the filtered/changed routes
   from the available routes.

   Some attributes are set only during transmission of the BGP message,
   i.e., post-policy.  It is common that the next hop may be null,
   loopback, or similar during the pre-policy phase.  All mandatory
   attributes, such as next hop, MUST be either zero or have an empty
   length if they are unknown at the pre-policy phase completion.  The
   BMP receiver will treat zero or empty mandatory attributes as self-
   originated.

   The L flag MUST be set to 0 to indicate pre-policy.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  BMP Messages</span>

   Many BMP messages have a per-peer header, but some are not applicable
   to Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out monitoring, such as Peer Up and Down
   Notifications.  Unless otherwise defined, the O flag should be set to
   0 in the per-peer header in BMP messages.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Route Monitoring and Route Mirroring</span>

   The O flag MUST be set accordingly to indicate if the route monitor
   or route mirroring message conveys Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Statistics Report</span>

   The Statistics Report message has a Stat Type field to indicate the
   statistic carried in the Stat Data field.  Statistics report messages
   are not specific to Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out and MUST have the O
   flag set to zero.  The O flag SHOULD be ignored by the BMP receiver.

   This document defines the following new statistics types:

   *  Stat Type = 14: Number of routes in pre-policy Adj-RIB-Out. This
      statistics type is 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Stat Type = 15: Number of routes in post-policy Adj-RIB-Out. This
      statistics type is 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Stat Type = 16: Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI pre-policy Adj-
      RIB-Out.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Stat Type = 17: Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI post-policy Adj-
      RIB-Out.  The value is structured as: 2-byte Address Family
      Identifier (AFI), 1-byte Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI), followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.3" href="#section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Peer Up and Down Notifications</span>

   Peer Up and Down Notifications convey BGP peering session state to
   BMP receivers.  The state is independent of whether or not route
   monitoring or route mirroring messages will be sent for Adj-RIB-In,
   Adj-RIB-Out, or both.  BMP receiver implementations SHOULD ignore the
   O flag in Peer Up and Down Notifications.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.3.1" href="#section-6.3.1">6.3.1</a>.  Peer Up Information</span>

   This document defines the following Peer Up Information TLV type:

   *  Type = 4: Admin Label.  The Information field contains a free-form
      UTF-8 string whose byte length is given by the Information Length
      field.  The value is administratively assigned.  There is no
      requirement to terminate the string with null or any other
      character.

      Multiple Admin Labels can be included in the Peer Up Notification.
      When multiple Admin Labels are included, the BMP receiver MUST
      preserve their order.

      The Admin Label is optional.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Other Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Peer and Update Groups</span>

   Peer and update groups are used to group updates shared by many
   peers.  This is a level of efficiency in implementations, not a true
   representation of what is conveyed to a peer in either pre-policy or
   post-policy.

   One of the use cases to monitor post-policy Adj-RIB-Out is to
   validate and continually ensure the egress updates match what is
   expected.  For example, wholesale peers should never have routes with
   community X:Y sent to them.  In this use case, there may be hundreds
   of wholesale peers, but a single peer could have represented the
   group.

   From a BMP perspective, it should be simple to include a group name
   in the Peer Up, but it is more complex than that.  BGP
   implementations have evolved to provide comprehensive and structured
   policy grouping, such as session, AFI/SAFI, and template-based group
   policy inheritances.

   This level of structure and inheritance of polices does not provide a
   simple peer group name or ID, such as wholesale peer.

   This document defines a new Admin Label type for Peer Up Information
   TLVs (<a href="#section-6.3.1">Section 6.3.1</a>) that can be used instead of requiring a group
   name.  These labels have administrative scope relevance.  For
   example, labels &quot;type=wholesale&quot; and &quot;region=west&quot; could be used to
   monitor expected policies.

   Configuration and assignment of labels to peers are BGP
   implementation-specific.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Changes to Existing BMP Session</span>

   In case of any change that results in the alteration of behavior of
   an existing BMP session (i.e., changes to filtering and table names),
   the session MUST be bounced with a Peer Down/Peer Up sequence.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The considerations in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7854#section-11">Section&nbsp;11 of [RFC7854]</a> apply to this document.
   Implementations of this protocol SHOULD require establishing sessions
   with authorized and trusted monitoring devices.  It is also believed
   that this document does not add any additional security
   considerations.
