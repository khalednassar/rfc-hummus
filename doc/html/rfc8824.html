Abstract

   This document defines how to compress Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) headers using the Static Context Header Compression
   and fragmentation (SCHC) framework.  SCHC defines a header
   compression mechanism adapted for Constrained Devices.  SCHC uses a
   static description of the header to reduce the header&#x27;s redundancy
   and size.  While <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724">RFC 8724</a> describes the SCHC compression and
   fragmentation framework, and its application for IPv6/UDP headers,
   this document applies SCHC to CoAP headers.  The CoAP header
   structure differs from IPv6 and UDP, since CoAP uses a flexible
   header with a variable number of options, themselves of variable
   length.  The CoAP message format is asymmetric: the request messages
   have a header format different from the format in the response
   messages.  This specification gives guidance on applying SCHC to
   flexible headers and how to leverage the asymmetry for more efficient
   compression Rules.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>] is a command/
   response protocol designed for microcontrollers with small RAM and
   ROM and optimized for services based on REST (Representational State
   Transfer).  Although the Constrained Devices are a leading factor in
   the design of CoAP, a CoAP header&#x27;s size is still too large for
   LPWANs (Low-Power Wide-Area Networks).  Static Context Header
   Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) over CoAP headers is required to
   increase performance or to use CoAP over LPWAN technologies.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8724">RFC8724</a>] defines the SCHC framework, which includes a header
   compression mechanism for LPWANs that is based on a static context.
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-5">Section&nbsp;5 of [RFC8724]</a> explains where compression and decompression
   occur in the architecture.  The SCHC compression scheme assumes as a
   prerequisite that both endpoints know the static context before
   transmission.  The way the context is configured, provisioned, or
   exchanged is out of this document&#x27;s scope.

   CoAP is an application protocol, so CoAP compression requires
   installing common Rules between the two SCHC instances.  SCHC
   compression may apply at two different levels: at IP and UDP in the
   LPWAN and another at the application level for CoAP.  These two
   compression techniques may be independent.  Both follow the same
   principle as that described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>].  As different entities
   manage the CoAP compression process at different levels, the SCHC
   Rules driving the compression/decompression are also different.
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>] describes how to use SCHC for IP and UDP headers.  This
   document specifies how to apply SCHC compression to CoAP headers.

   SCHC compresses and decompresses headers based on common contexts
   between Devices.  The SCHC context includes multiple Rules.  Each
   Rule can match the header fields to specific values or ranges of
   values.  If a Rule matches, the matched header fields are replaced by
   the RuleID and the Compression Residue that contains the residual
   bits of the compression.  Thus, different Rules may correspond to
   different protocol headers in the packet that a Device expects to
   send or receive.

   A Rule describes the packets&#x27; entire header with an ordered list of
   Field Descriptors; see <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-7">Section&nbsp;7 of [RFC8724]</a>.  Thereby, each
   description contains the Field ID (FID), Field Length (FL), and Field
   Position (FP), as well as a Direction Indicator (DI) (upstream,
   downstream, and bidirectional) and some associated Target Values
   (TVs).  The DI is used for compression to give the best TV to the FID
   when these values differ in their transmission direction.  So, a
   field may be described several times.

   A Matching Operator (MO) is associated with each header Field
   Descriptor.  The Rule is selected if all the MOs fit the TVs for all
   fields of the incoming header.  A Rule cannot be selected if the
   message contains a field that is unknown to the SCHC compressor.

   In that case, a Compression/Decompression Action (CDA) associated
   with each field gives the method to compress and decompress each
   field.  Compression mainly results in one of four actions:

   *  send the field value (value-sent),

   *  send nothing (not-sent),

   *  send some Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of the field, or

   *  send an index (mapping-sent).

   After applying the compression, there may be some bits to be sent.
   These values are called &quot;Compression Residue&quot;.

   SCHC is a general mechanism applied to different protocols, with the
   exact Rules to be used depending on the protocol and the application.
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-10">Section&nbsp;10 of [RFC8724]</a> describes the compression scheme for IPv6 and
   UDP headers.  This document targets CoAP header compression using
   SCHC.

   SCHC compression for CoAP headers MAY be done in conjunction with the
   lower layers (IPv6/UDP) or independently.  The SCHC adaptation
   layers, described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-5">Section&nbsp;5 of [RFC8724]</a>, may be used as shown in
   Figures 1, 2, and 3.

   In the first example, Figure 1, a Rule compresses the complete header
   stack from IPv6 to CoAP.  In this case, the Device and the Network
   Gateway (NGW) perform SCHC C/D (SCHC Compression/Decompression; see
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>]).  The application communicating with the Device does not
   implement SCHC C/D.

         Figure 1: Compression/Decompression at the LPWAN Boundary

   Figure 1 shows the use of SCHC header compression above Layer 2 in
   the Device and the NGW.  The SCHC layer receives non-encrypted
   packets and can apply compression Rules to all the headers in the
   stack.  On the other end, the NGW receives the SCHC packet and
   reconstructs the headers using the Rule and the Compression Residue.
   After the decompression, the NGW forwards the IPv6 packet toward the
   destination.  The same process applies in the other direction when a
   non-encrypted packet arrives at the NGW.  Thanks to the IP forwarding
   based on the IPv6 prefix, the NGW identifies the Device and
   compresses headers using the Device&#x27;s Rules.

   In the second example, Figure 2, SCHC compression is applied in the
   CoAP layer, compressing the CoAP header independently of the other
   layers.  The RuleID, Compression Residue, and CoAP payload are
   encrypted using a mechanism such as DTLS.  Only the other end (App)
   can decipher the information.  If needed, layers below use SCHC to
   compress the header as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>] (represented by dotted
   lines in the figure).

   This use case needs an end-to-end context initialization between the
   Device and the application.  The context initialization is out of
   scope for this document.

   Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8613" title="&quot;Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)&quot;">RFC8613</a>].  In this case,
   SCHC needs two Rules to compress the CoAP header.  A first Rule
   focuses on the Inner header.  The result of this first compression is
   encrypted using the OSCORE mechanism.  Then, a second Rule compresses
   the Outer header, including the OSCORE options.

                 Figure 3: OSCORE Compression/Decompression

   In the case of several SCHC instances, as shown in Figures 2 and 3,
   the Rules may come from different provisioning domains.

   This document focuses on CoAP compression, as represented by the
   dashed boxes in the previous figures.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  CoAP Headers Compressed with SCHC</span>

   The use of SCHC over the CoAP header applies the same description and
   compression/decompression techniques as the technique used for IP and
   UDP, as explained in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>].  For CoAP, the SCHC Rules description
   uses the direction information to optimize the compression by
   reducing the number of Rules needed to compress headers.  The Field
   Descriptor MAY define both request/response headers and TVs in the
   same Rule, using the DI to indicate the header type.

   As for other header compression protocols, when the compressor does
   not find a correct Rule to compress the header, the packet MUST be
   sent uncompressed using the RuleID dedicated to this purpose, and
   where the Compression Residue is the complete header of the packet.
   See <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-6">Section&nbsp;6 of [RFC8724]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Differences between CoAP and UDP/IP Compression</span>

   CoAP compression differs from IPv6 and UDP compression in the
   following aspects:

   *  The CoAP message format is asymmetric; the headers are different
      for a request or a response.  For example, the Uri-Path option is
      mandatory in the request, and it might not be present in the
      response.  A request might contain an Accept option, and the
      response might include a Content-Format option.  In comparison,
      the IPv6 and UDP returning path swaps the value of some fields in
      the header.  However, all the directions have the same fields
      (e.g., source and destination address fields).

      [<a id="ref-RFC8724">RFC8724</a>] defines the use of a DI in the Field Descriptor, which
      allows a single Rule to process a message header differently,
      depending on the direction.

   *  Even when a field is &quot;symmetric&quot; (i.e., found in both directions),
      the values carried in each direction are different.  The
      compression may use a &quot;match-mapping&quot; MO to limit the range of
      expected values in a particular direction and reduce the
      Compression Residue&#x27;s size.  Through the DI, a Field Descriptor in
      the Rules splits the possible field value into two parts, one for
      each direction.  For instance, if a client sends only Confirmable
      (CON) requests [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>], the Type can be elided by compression,
      and the answer may use one single bit to carry either the ACK or
      Reset (RST) type.  The field Code has the same behavior: the 0.0X
      code format value in the request and the Y.ZZ code format in the
      response.

   *  In SCHC, the Rule defines the different header fields&#x27; length, so
      SCHC does not need to send it.  In IPv6 and UDP headers, the
      fields have a fixed size, known by definition.  On the other hand,
      some CoAP header fields have variable lengths, and the Rule
      description specifies it.  For example, in a Uri-Path or Uri-
      Query, the Token size may vary from 0 to 8 bytes, and the CoAP
      options use the Type-Length-Value encoding format.

      When doing SCHC compression of a variable-length field,
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-7.4.2">Section&nbsp;7.4.2 of [RFC8724]</a> offers the option of defining a
      function for the Field Length in the Field Descriptor to know the
      length before compression.  If the Field Length is unknown, the
      Rule will set it as a variable, and SCHC will send the compressed
      field&#x27;s length in the Compression Residue.

   *  A field can appear several times in the CoAP headers.  It is found
      typically for elements of a URI (path or queries).  The SCHC
      specification [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>] allows a FID to appear several times in
      the Rule and uses the Field Position (FP) to identify the correct
      instance, thereby removing the MO&#x27;s ambiguity.

   *  Field Lengths defined in CoAP can be too large when it comes to
      LPWAN traffic constraints.  For instance, this is particularly
      true for the Message ID field and the Token field.  SCHC uses
      different MOs to perform the compression.  See <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-7.4">Section&nbsp;7.4 of
      [RFC8724]</a>.  In this case, SCHC can apply the Most Significant Bits
      (MSBs) MO to reduce the information carried on LPWANs.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Compression of CoAP Header Fields</span>

   This section discusses the compression of the different CoAP header
   fields.  CoAP compression with SCHC follows the information provided
   in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-7.1">Section&nbsp;7.1 of [RFC8724]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  CoAP Version Field</span>

   The CoAP version is bidirectional and MUST be elided during SCHC
   compression, since it always contains the same value.  In the future,
   or if a new version of CoAP is defined, new Rules will be needed to
   avoid ambiguities between versions.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  CoAP Type Field</span>

   CoAP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>] has four types of messages: two requests (CON, NON),
   one response (ACK), and one empty message (RST).

   The SCHC compression scheme SHOULD elide this field if, for instance,
   a client is sending only Non-confirmable (NON) messages or only CON
   messages.  For the RST message, SCHC may use a dedicated Rule.  For
   other usages, SCHC can use a &quot;match-mapping&quot; MO.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  CoAP Code Field</span>

   The Code field, defined in an IANA registry [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>], indicates the
   Request Method used in CoAP.  The compression of the CoAP Code field
   follows the same principle as that of the CoAP Type field.  If the
   Device plays a specific role, SCHC may split the code values into two
   Field Descriptors: (1) the request codes with the 0 class and (2) the
   response values.  SCHC will use the DI to identify the correct value
   in the packet.

   If the Device only implements a CoAP client, SCHC compression may
   reduce the request code to the set of requests the client can
   process.

   For known values, SCHC can use a &quot;match-mapping&quot; MO.  If SCHC cannot
   compress the Code field, it will send the values in the Compression
   Residue.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  CoAP Message ID Field</span>

   SCHC can compress the Message ID field with the &quot;MSB&quot; MO and the
   &quot;LSB&quot; CDA.  See <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-7.4">Section&nbsp;7.4 of [RFC8724]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  CoAP Token Fields</span>

   CoAP defines the Token using two CoAP fields: Token Length in the
   mandatory header and Token Value directly following the mandatory
   CoAP header.

   SCHC processes the Token Length as it would any header field.  If the
   value does not change, the size can be stored in the TV and elided
   during the transmission.  Otherwise, SCHC will send the Token Length
   in the Compression Residue.

   For the Token Value, SCHC MUST NOT send it as variable-length data in
   the Compression Residue, to avoid ambiguity with the Token Length.
   Therefore, SCHC MUST use the Token Length value to define the size of
   the Compression Residue.  SCHC designates a specific function, &quot;tkl&quot;,
   that the Rule MUST use to complete the Field Descriptor.  During the
   decompression, this function returns the value contained in the Token
   Length field.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  CoAP Options</span>

   CoAP defines options placed after the basic header, ordered by option
   number; see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>].  Each Option instance in a message uses the
   format Delta-Type (D-T), Length (L), Value (V).  The SCHC Rule builds
   the description of the option by using the following:

   *  in the FID: the option number built from the D-T;

   *  in the TV: the option value; and

   *  for the Option Length: the information provided in Sections <a href="#section-7.4.1">7.4.1</a>
      and 7.4.2 of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>].

   When the Option Length has a well-known size, the Rule may keep the
   length value.  Therefore, SCHC compression does not send it.
   Otherwise, SCHC compression carries the length of the Compression
   Residue, in addition to the Compression Residue value.

   CoAP requests and responses do not include the same options.  So,
   compression Rules may reflect this asymmetry by tagging the DI.

   Note that length coding differs between CoAP options and SCHC
   variable size Compression Residue.

   The following sections present how SCHC compresses some specific CoAP
   options.

   If CoAP introduces a new option, the SCHC Rules MAY be updated, and
   the new FID description MUST be assigned to allow its compression.
   Otherwise, if no Rule describes this new option, SCHC compression is
   not achieved, and SCHC sends the CoAP header without compression.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  CoAP Content and Accept Options</span>

   If the client expects a single value, it can be stored in the TV and
   elided during the transmission.  Otherwise, if the client expects
   several possible values, a &quot;match-mapping&quot; MO SHOULD be used to limit
   the Compression Residue&#x27;s size.  If not, SCHC has to send the option
   value in the Compression Residue (fixed or variable length).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  CoAP Option Max-Age, Uri-Host, and Uri-Port Fields</span>

   SCHC compresses these three fields in the same way.  When the values
   of these options are known, SCHC can elide these fields.  If the
   option uses well-known values, SCHC can use a &quot;match-mapping&quot; MO.
   Otherwise, SCHC will use the &quot;value-sent&quot; MO, and the Compression
   Residue will send these options&#x27; values.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  CoAP Option Uri-Path and Uri-Query Fields</span>

   The Uri-Path and Uri-Query fields are repeatable options; this means
   that in the CoAP header, they may appear several times with different
   values.  The SCHC Rule description uses the FP to distinguish the
   different instances in the path.

   To compress repeatable field values, SCHC may use a &quot;match-mapping&quot;
   MO to reduce the size of variable paths or queries.  In these cases,
   to optimize the compression, several elements can be regrouped into a
   single entry.  The numbering of elements does not change, and the
   first matching element sets the MO comparison.

   In Table 1, SCHC can use a single bit in the Compression Residue to
   code one of the two paths.  If regrouping were not allowed, 2 bits in
   the Compression Residue would be needed.  SCHC sends the third path
   element as a variable size in the Compression Residue.

     +==========+=====+====+====+==========+=========+==============+
     |  Field   |  FL | FP | DI |    TV    |    MO   |     CDA      |
     +==========+=====+====+====+==========+=========+==============+
     | Uri-Path |     | 1  | Up | [&quot;/a/b&quot;, | match-  | mapping-sent |
     |          |     |    |    | &quot;/c/d&quot;]  | mapping |              |
     +----------+-----+----+----+----------+---------+--------------+
     | Uri-Path | var | 3  | Up |          | ignore  | value-sent   |
     +----------+-----+----+----+----------+---------+--------------+

                      Table 1: Complex Path Example

   The length of Uri-Path and Uri-Query may be known when the Rule is
   defined.  In any case, SCHC MUST set the Field Length to a variable
   value.  The Compression Residue size is expressed in bytes.

   SCHC compression can use the MSB MO to a Uri-Path or Uri-Query
   element.  However, attention to the length is important because the
   MSB value is in bits, and the size MUST always be a multiple of 8
   bits.

   The length sent at the beginning of a variable-length Compression
   Residue indicates the LSB&#x27;s size in bytes.

   For instance, for a CORECONF path /c/X6?k=eth0, the Rule description
   can be as follows (Table 2):

        +===========+=====+====+====+======+=========+============+
        |   Field   |  FL | FP | DI |  TV  |    MO   |    CDA     |
        +===========+=====+====+====+======+=========+============+
        | Uri-Path  |     | 1  | Up | &quot;c&quot;  | equal   | not-sent   |
        +-----------+-----+----+----+------+---------+------------+
        | Uri-Path  | var | 2  | Up |      | ignore  | value-sent |
        +-----------+-----+----+----+------+---------+------------+
        | Uri-Query | var | 1  | Up | &quot;k=&quot; | MSB(16) | LSB        |
        +-----------+-----+----+----+------+---------+------------+

                     Table 2: CORECONF URI Compression

   Table 2 shows the Rule description for a Uri-Path and a Uri-Query.
   SCHC compresses the first part of the Uri-Path with a &quot;not-sent&quot; CDA.
   SCHC will send the second element of the Uri-Path with the length
   (i.e., 0x2 &quot;X6&quot;) followed by the query option (i.e., 0x4 &quot;eth0&quot;).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3.1" href="#section-5.3.1">5.3.1</a>.  Variable Number of Path or Query Elements</span>

   SCHC fixed the number of Uri-Path or Uri-Query elements in a Rule at
   the Rule creation time.  If the number varies, SCHC SHOULD either

   *  create several Rules to cover all possibilities or

   *  create a Rule that defines several entries for Uri-Path to cover
      the longest path and send a Compression Residue with a length of 0
      to indicate that a Uri-Path entry is empty.

   However, this adds 4 bits to the variable Compression Residue size.
   See <a href="/doc/html/rfc8724#section-7.4.2">Section&nbsp;7.4.2 of [RFC8724]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.4" href="#section-5.4">5.4</a>.  CoAP Option Size1, Size2, Proxy-URI, and Proxy-Scheme Fields</span>

   The SCHC Rule description MAY define sending some field values by
   setting the TV to &quot;not-sent&quot;, the MO to &quot;ignore&quot;, and the CDA to
   &quot;value-sent&quot;.  A Rule MAY also use a &quot;match-mapping&quot; MO when there
   are different options for the same FID.  Otherwise, the Rule sets the
   TV to the value, the MO to &quot;equal&quot;, and the CDA to &quot;not-sent&quot;.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.5" href="#section-5.5">5.5</a>.  CoAP Option ETag, If-Match, If-None-Match, Location-Path, and</span>
<span class="h3">      Location-Query Fields</span>

   A Rule entry cannot store these fields&#x27; values.  The Rule description
   MUST always send these values in the Compression Residue.

   When a packet uses a Block option [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7959" title="&quot;Block-Wise Transfers in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7959</a>], SCHC compression MUST
   send its content in the Compression Residue.  The SCHC Rule describes
   an empty TV with the MO set to &quot;ignore&quot; and the CDA set to &quot;value-
   sent&quot;.  The Block option allows fragmentation at the CoAP level that
   is compatible with SCHC fragmentation.  Both fragmentation mechanisms
   are complementary, and the node may use them for the same packet as
   needed.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Observe</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC7641">RFC7641</a>] defines the Observe Option.  The SCHC Rule description will
   not define the TV but will set the MO to &quot;ignore&quot; and the CDA to
   &quot;value-sent&quot;.  SCHC does not limit the maximum size for this option
   (3 bytes).  To reduce the transmission size, either the Device
   implementation MAY limit the delta between two consecutive values or
   a proxy can modify the increment.

   Since the Observe Option MAY use a RST message to inform a server
   that the client does not require the Observe response, a specific
   SCHC Rule SHOULD exist to allow the message&#x27;s compression with the
   RST type.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.3" href="#section-6.3">6.3</a>.  No-Response</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC7967">RFC7967</a>] defines a No-Response option limiting the responses made by
   a server to a request.  Different behaviors exist while using this
   option to limit the responses made by a server to a request.  If both
   ends know the value, then the SCHC Rule will describe a TV to this
   value, with the MO set to &quot;equal&quot; and the CDA set to &quot;not-sent&quot;.

   Otherwise, if the value is changing over time, the SCHC Rule will set
   the MO to &quot;ignore&quot; and the CDA to &quot;value-sent&quot;.  The Rule may also
   use a &quot;match-mapping&quot; MO to compress this option.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.4" href="#section-6.4">6.4</a>.  OSCORE</span>

   OSCORE [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8613" title="&quot;Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)&quot;">RFC8613</a>] defines end-to-end protection for CoAP messages.
   This section describes how SCHC Rules can be applied to compress
   OSCORE-protected messages.

   Figure 4 shows the OSCORE option value encoding defined in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8613#section-6.1">Section&nbsp;6.1 of [RFC8613]</a>, where the first byte specifies the content
   of the OSCORE options using flags.  The three most significant bits
   of this byte are reserved and always set to 0.  Bit h, when set,
   indicates the presence of the kid context field in the option.  Bit
   k, when set, indicates the presence of a kid field.  The three least
   significant bits, n, indicate the length of the piv (Partial
   Initialization Vector) field in bytes.  When n = 0, no piv is
   present.

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &lt;--------- n bytes -------------&gt;

           OSCORE_flags

         &lt;- 1 byte -&gt; &lt;------ s bytes -----&gt;
        +------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

        |                                   |                       |
        | &lt;------ CoAP OSCORE_kidctx ------&gt;|&lt;-- CoAP OSCORE_kid --&gt;|

                          Figure 4: OSCORE Option

   The flag byte is followed by the piv field, the kid context field,
   and the kid field, in that order, and, if present, the kid context
   field&#x27;s length (in bytes) is encoded in the first byte, denoted by
   &quot;s&quot;.

   To better perform OSCORE SCHC compression, the Rule description needs
   to identify the OSCORE option and the fields it contains.
   Conceptually, it discerns up to four distinct pieces of information
   within the OSCORE option: the flag bits, the piv, the kid context,
   and the kid.  The SCHC Rule splits the OSCORE option into four Field
   Descriptors in order to compress them:

   *  CoAP OSCORE_flags

   *  CoAP OSCORE_piv

   *  CoAP OSCORE_kidctx

   *  CoAP OSCORE_kid

   Figure 4 shows the OSCORE option format with those four fields
   superimposed on it.  Note that the CoAP OSCORE_kidctx field directly
   includes the size octet, s.

   In this first scenario, the SCHC compressor on the NGW side receives
   a POST message from an Internet client, which is immediately
   acknowledged by the Device.  Table 3 describes the SCHC Rule
   descriptions for this scenario.

           Table 3: CoAP Context to Compress Header without Token

   In this example, SCHC compression elides the version and Token Length
   fields.  The 25 Method and Response Codes defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>] have
   been shrunk to 5 bits using a &quot;match-mapping&quot; MO.  The Uri-Path
   contains a single element indicated in the TV and elided with the CDA
   &quot;not-sent&quot;.

   SCHC compression reduces the header, sending only the Type, a mapped
   code, and the least significant bits of the Message ID (9 bits in the
   example above).

   Note that a client located in an Application Server sending a request
   to a server located in the Device may not be compressed through this
   Rule, since the MID might not start with 7 bits equal to 0.  A CoAP
   proxy placed before SCHC C/D can rewrite the Message ID to fit the
   value and match the Rule.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  OSCORE Compression</span>

   OSCORE aims to solve the problem of end-to-end encryption for CoAP
   messages.  Therefore, the goal is to hide the message as much as
   possible while still enabling proxy operation.

   Conceptually, this is achieved by splitting the CoAP message into an
   Inner Plaintext and Outer OSCORE message.  The Inner Plaintext
   contains sensitive information that is not necessary for proxy
   operation.  However, it is part of the message that can be encrypted
   until it reaches its end destination.  The Outer Message acts as a
   shell matching the regular CoAP message format and includes all
   options and information needed for proxy operation and caching.
   Figure 5 below illustrates this analysis.

   CoAP arranges the options into one of three classes, each granted a
   specific type of protection by the protocol:

   Class E:  Encrypted options moved to the Inner Plaintext.

   Class I:  Integrity-protected options included in the Additional
      Authenticated Data (AAD) for the encryption of the Plaintext but
      otherwise left untouched in the Outer Message.

   Class U:  Unprotected options left untouched in the Outer Message.

   These classes point out that the Outer option contains the OSCORE
   option and that the message is OSCORE protected; this option carries
   the information necessary to retrieve the Security Context.  The
   endpoint will use this Security Context to decrypt the message
   correctly.

     Figure 5: CoAP Packet Split into OSCORE Outer Header and Plaintext

   Figure 5 shows the packet format for the OSCORE Outer header and
   Plaintext.

   In the Outer header, the original header code is hidden and replaced
   by a default dummy value.  As seen in Sections <a href="#section-4.1.3.5">4.1.3.5</a> and <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a> of
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8613" title="&quot;Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)&quot;">RFC8613</a>], the message code is replaced by POST for requests and
   Changed for responses when CoAP is not using the Observe Option.  If
   CoAP uses Observe, the OSCORE message code is replaced by FETCH for
   requests and Content for responses.

   The first byte of the Plaintext contains the original packet code,
   followed by the message code, the class E options, and, if present,
   the original message payload preceded by its payload marker.

   An Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm now
   encrypts the Plaintext.  This integrity-protects the Security Context
   parameters and, eventually, any class I options from the Outer
   header.  The resulting ciphertext becomes the new payload of the
   OSCORE message, as illustrated in Figure 6.

   As defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5116" title="&quot;An Interface and Algorithms for Authenticated Encryption&quot;">RFC5116</a>], this ciphertext is the encrypted Plaintext&#x27;s
   concatenation of the Authentication Tag. Note that Inner Compression
   only affects the Plaintext before encryption.  The Authentication
   Tag, fixed in length and uncompressed, is considered part of the cost
   of protection.

                          Figure 6: OSCORE Message

   The SCHC compression scheme consists of compressing both the
   Plaintext before encryption and the resulting OSCORE message after
   encryption; see Figure 7.

   The OSCORE message translates into a segmented process where SCHC
   compression is applied independently in two stages, each with its
   corresponding set of Rules, with the Inner SCHC Rules and the Outer
   SCHC Rules.  This way, compression is applied to all fields of the
   original CoAP message.

   Note that since the corresponding endpoint can only decrypt the Inner
   part of the message, this endpoint will also have to implement Inner
   SCHC Compression/Decompression.

   This section gives an example with a GET request and its consequent

   CoAP server.  The example also describes a possible set of Rules for
   Inner SCHC Compression and Outer SCHC Compression.  A dump of the

      Figure 10: Plaintext Compression and Encryption for GET Request

   In this case, the original message has no payload, and its resulting
   Plaintext is compressed up to only 1 byte (the size of the RuleID).
   The AEAD algorithm preserves this length in its first output and
   yields a fixed-size tag.  SCHC cannot compress the tag, and the
   OSCORE message must include it without compression.  The use of
   integrity protection translates into an overhead in total message
   length, limiting the amount of compression that can be achieved and
   playing into the cost of adding security to the exchange.

   Figure 11 shows the process for the example Content response.  The
   Compression Residue is 1 bit long.  Note that since SCHC adds padding
   after the payload, this misalignment causes the hexadecimal code from
   the payload to differ from the original, even if SCHC cannot compress
   the tag.  The overhead for the tag bytes limits SCHC&#x27;s performance
   but brings security to the transmission.

      Figure 13: Protected and Inner SCHC Compressed Content Response

   For the flag bits, some SCHC compression methods are useful,
   depending on the application.  The most straightforward alternative
   is to provide a fixed value for the flags, combining a MO of &quot;equal&quot;
   and a CDA of &quot;not-sent&quot;.  This SCHC definition saves most bits but
   could prevent flexibility.  Otherwise, SCHC could use a &quot;match-
   mapping&quot; MO to choose from several configurations for the exchange.
   If not, the SCHC description may use an &quot;MSB&quot; MO to mask off the
   three hard-coded most significant bits.

   Note that fixing a flag bit will limit the choices of CoAP options
   that can be used in the exchange, since the values of these choices
   are dependent on specific options.

   The piv field lends itself to having some bits masked off with an
   &quot;MSB&quot; MO and an &quot;LSB&quot; CDA.  This SCHC description could be useful in
   applications where the message frequency is low, such as LPWAN
   technologies.  Note that compressing the sequence numbers may reduce
   the maximum number of sequence numbers that can be used in an
   exchange.  Once the sequence number exceeds the maximum value, the
   OSCORE keys need to be re-established.

   The size, s, that is included in the kid context field MAY be masked
   off with an &quot;LSB&quot; CDA.  The rest of the field could have additional
   bits masked off or have the whole field fixed with a MO of &quot;equal&quot;
   and a CDA of &quot;not-sent&quot;.  The same holds for the kid field.

   The Outer Rule of Table 5 is applied to the example GET request and
   Content response.  Figures 14 and 15 show the resulting messages.

   In contrast, comparing these results with what would be obtained by
   SCHC compressing the original CoAP messages without protecting them
   with OSCORE is done by compressing the CoAP messages according to the
   SCHC Rule in Table 6.

                    Table 6: SCHC-CoAP Rule (No OSCORE)

   The Rule in Table 6 yields the SCHC compression results as shown in
   Figure 16 for the request and Figure 17 for the response.

   Compressed message:
   ==================
   0x0114
   0x01 = RuleID

   Compression Residue:
   0b00010100 (1 byte)

   Compressed message length: 2 bytes

               Figure 16: CoAP GET Compressed without OSCORE

   Compressed message:
   ==================
   0x010a32332043
   0x01 = RuleID

   Compression Residue:
   0b00001010 (1 byte)

   Payload
   0x32332043

   Compressed message length: 6 bytes

             Figure 17: CoAP Content Compressed without OSCORE

   As can be seen, the difference between applying SCHC + OSCORE as
   compared to regular SCHC + CoAP is about 10 bytes.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-9" href="#section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The use of SCHC header compression for CoAP header fields only
   affects the representation of the header information.  SCHC header
   compression itself does not increase or decrease the overall level of
   security of the communication.  When the connection does not use a
   security protocol (OSCORE, DTLS, etc.), it is necessary to use a
   Layer 2 security mechanism to protect the SCHC messages.

   If an LPWAN is the Layer 2 technology being used, the SCHC security
   considerations discussed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>] continue to apply.  When using
   another Layer 2 protocol, the use of a cryptographic integrity-
   protection mechanism to protect the SCHC headers is REQUIRED.  Such
   cryptographic integrity protection is necessary in order to continue
   to provide the properties that [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8724" title="&quot;SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation&quot;">RFC8724</a>] relies upon.

   When SCHC is used with OSCORE, the security considerations discussed
   in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8613" title="&quot;Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)&quot;">RFC8613</a>] continue to apply.

   When SCHC is used with the OSCORE Outer headers, the Initialization
   Vector (IV) size in the Compression Residue must be carefully
   selected.  There is a trade-off between compression efficiency (with
   a longer &quot;MSB&quot; MO prefix) and the frequency at which the Device must
   renew its key material (in order to prevent the IV from expanding to
   an uncompressible value).  The key-renewal operation itself requires
   several message exchanges and requires energy-intensive computation,
   but the optimal trade-off will depend on the specifics of the Device
   and expected usage patterns.

   If an attacker can introduce a corrupted SCHC-compressed packet onto
   a link, DoS attacks can be mounted by causing excessive resource
   consumption at the decompressor.  However, an attacker able to inject
   packets at the link layer is also capable of other, potentially more
   damaging, attacks.

   SCHC compression emits variable-length Compression Residues for some
   CoAP fields.  In the representation of the compressed header, the
   length field that is sent is not the length of the original header
   field but rather the length of the Compression Residue that is being
   transmitted.  If a corrupted packet arrives at the decompressor with
   a longer or shorter length than the original compressed
   representation possessed, the SCHC decompression procedures will
   detect an error and drop the packet.

   SCHC header compression Rules MUST remain tightly coupled between the
   compressor and the decompressor.  If the compression Rules get out of
   sync, a Compression Residue might be decompressed differently at the
   receiver than the initial message submitted to compression
   procedures.  Accordingly, any time the context Rules are updated on
   an OSCORE endpoint, that endpoint MUST trigger OSCORE key re-
   establishment.  Similar procedures may be appropriate to signal Rule
   updates when other message-protection mechanisms are in use.
