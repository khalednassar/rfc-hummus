Abstract

   This document proposes a notational convention to express Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) data structures (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049">RFC 7049</a>).  Its
   main goal is to provide an easy and unambiguous way to express
   structures for protocol messages and data formats that use CBOR or
   JSON.

   Object Representation (CBOR) data structures [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] is defined.

   The main goal for the convention is to provide a unified notation
   that can be used when defining protocols that use CBOR.  We term the
   convention &quot;Concise Data Definition Language&quot;, or CDDL.

   The CBOR notational convention has the following goals:

   (G1)  Provide an unambiguous description of the overall structure of
         a CBOR data item.

   (G2)  Be flexible in expressing the multiple ways in which data can
         be represented in the CBOR data format.

   (G3)  Be able to express common CBOR datatypes and structures.

   (G4)  Provide a single format that is both readable and editable for
         humans and processable by a machine.

   (G5)  Enable automatic checking of CBOR data items for data format
         compliance.

   (G6)  Enable extraction of specific elements from CBOR data for
         further processing.

   Not an original goal per se, but a convenient side effect of the JSON
   generic data model being a subset of the CBOR generic data model, is
   the fact that CDDL can also be used for describing JSON data
   structures (see <a href="#appendix-E">Appendix E</a>).

   This document has the following structure:

   The syntax of CDDL is defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  Examples of CDDL and a
   related CBOR data item (&quot;instance&quot;), some of which use the JSON form,
   are described in <a href="#appendix-H">Appendix H</a>.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> discusses usage of CDDL.
   Examples are provided throughout the text to better illustrate
   concept definitions.  A formal definition of CDDL using ABNF grammar
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5234" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>] is provided in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Finally, a _prelude_ of
   standard CDDL definitions that is automatically prepended to, and
   thus available in, every CDDL specification is listed in <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   New terms are introduced in _cursive_, which is rendered in plain
   text as the new term surrounded by underscores.  CDDL text in the
   running text is in &quot;typewriter&quot;, which is rendered in plain text as
   the CDDL text in double quotes (double quotes are also used in the
   usual English sense; the reader is expected to disambiguate this by
   context).

   In this specification, the term &quot;byte&quot; is used in its now-customary
   sense as a synonym for &quot;octet&quot;.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  The Style of Data Structure Specification</span>

   CDDL focuses on styles of specification that are in use in the
   community employing the data model as pioneered by JSON and now
   refined in CBOR.

   There are a number of more or less atomic elements of a CBOR data
   model, such as numbers, simple values (false, true, nil), text
   strings, and byte strings; CDDL does not focus on specifying their
   structure.  CDDL of course also allows adding a CBOR tag to a
   data item.

   Beyond those atomic elements, further components of a data structure
   definition language are the datatypes used for composition: arrays
   and maps in CBOR (called &quot;arrays&quot; and &quot;objects&quot; in JSON).  While
   these are only two representation formats, they are used to specify
   four loosely distinguishable styles of composition:

   o  A _vector_: an array of elements that are mostly of the same
      semantics.  The set of signatures associated with a signed data
      item is a typical application of a vector.

   o  A _record_: an array the elements of which have different,
      positionally defined semantics, as detailed in the data structure
      definition.  A 2D point, specified as an array of an x coordinate
      (which comes first) and a y coordinate (coming second), is an
      example of a record, as is the pair of exponent (first) and
      mantissa (second) in a CBOR decimal fraction.

   o  A _table_: a map from a domain of map keys to a domain of map
      values, that are mostly of the same semantics.  A set of language
      tags, each mapped to a text string translated to that specific
      language, is an example of a table.  The key domain is usually not
      limited to a specific set by the specification but is open for the
      application, e.g., in a table mapping IP addresses to Media Access
      Control (MAC) addresses, the specification does not attempt to
      foresee all possible IP addresses.  In a language such as
      JavaScript, a &quot;Map&quot; (as opposed to a plain &quot;Object&quot;) would often
      be employed to achieve the generality of the key domain.

   o  A _struct_: a map from a domain of map keys as defined by the
      specification to a domain of map values the semantics of each of
      which is bound to a specific map key.  This is what many people
      have in mind when they think about JSON objects; CBOR adds the
      ability to use map keys that are not just text strings.  Structs
      can be used to solve problems similar to those records are used
      for; the use of explicit map keys facilitates optionality and
      extensibility.

   Two important concepts provide the foundation for CDDL:

   1.  Instead of defining all four types of composition in CDDL
       separately, or even defining one kind for arrays (vectors and
       records) and one kind for maps (tables and structs), there is
       only one kind of composition in CDDL: the _group_ (<a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>).

   2.  The other important concept is that of a _type_.  The entire CDDL
       specification defines a type (the one defined by its first
       _rule_), which formally is the set of CBOR data items that are
       acceptable as &quot;instances&quot; for this specification.  CDDL
       predefines a number of basic types such as &quot;uint&quot; (unsigned
       integer) or &quot;tstr&quot; (text string), often making use of a simple
       formal notation for CBOR data items.  Each value that can be
       expressed as a CBOR data item is also a type in its own right,
       e.g., &quot;1&quot;.  A type can be built as a _choice_ of other types,
       e.g., an &quot;int&quot; is either a &quot;uint&quot; or a &quot;nint&quot; (negative integer).
       Finally, a type can be built as an array or a map from a group.

   The rest of this section introduces a number of basic concepts of
   CDDL, and <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> defines additional syntax.  <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a> gives a
   concise summary of the semantics of CDDL.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc8610">RFC 8610</a>                          CDDL                         June 2019</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Groups and Composition in CDDL</span>

   CDDL groups are lists of group _entries_, each of which can be a
   name/value pair or a more complex group expression (which then in
   turn stands for a sequence of name/value pairs).  A CDDL group is a
   production in a grammar that matches certain sequences of name/value
   pairs but not others.  The grammar is based on the concepts of
   Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).

   In an array context, only the value of the name/value pair is
   represented; the name is annotation only (and can be left off from
   the group specification if not needed).  In a map context, the names
   become the map keys (&quot;member keys&quot;).

   In an array context, the actual sequence of elements in the group is
   important, as that sequence is the information that allows
   associating actual array elements with entries in the group.  In a
   map context, the sequence of entries in a group is not relevant (but
   there is still a need to write down group entries in a sequence).

   An array matches a specification given as a group when the group
   matches a sequence of name/value pairs the value parts of which
   exactly match the elements of the array in order.

   A map matches a specification given as a group when the group matches
   a sequence of name/value pairs such that all of these name/value
   pairs are present in the map and the map has no name/value pair that
   is not covered by the group.

   A simple example of using a group directly in a map definition is:

                             person = {
                               age: int,
                               name: tstr,
                               employer: tstr,
                             }

                 Figure 1: Using a Group Directly in a Map

   The three entries of the group are written between the curly braces
   that create the map: here, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, and &quot;employer&quot; are the
   names that turn into the map key text strings, and &quot;int&quot; and &quot;tstr&quot;
   (text string) are the types of the map values under these keys.

   A group by itself (without creating a map around it) can be placed in
   (round) parentheses and given a name by using it in a rule:

                             pii = (
                               age: int,
                               name: tstr,
                               employer: tstr,
                             )

                          Figure 2: A Basic Group

   This separate, named group definition allows us to rephrase
   Figure 1 as:

                                person = {
                                  pii
                                }

                      Figure 3: Using a Group by Name

   Note that the (curly) braces signify the creation of a map; the
   groups themselves are neutral as to whether they will be used in a
   map or an array.

   As shown in Figure 1, the parentheses for groups are optional when
   there is some other set of brackets present.  Note that they can
   still be used, leading to this not-so-realistic, but perfectly valid,
   example:

                             person = {(
                               age: int,
                               name: tstr,
                               employer: tstr,
                             )}

   Groups can be used to factor out common parts of structs, e.g.,
   instead of writing specifications in copy/paste style, such as in
   Figure 5, one can factor out the common subgroup, choose a name for
   it, and write only the specific parts into the individual maps
   (Figure 6).

                          person = {
                            age: int,
                            name: tstr,
                            employer: tstr,
                          }

                          dog = {
                            age: int,
                            name: tstr,
                            leash-length: float,
                          }

                      Figure 5: Maps with Copy/Paste

                          person = {
                            identity,
                            employer: tstr,
                          }

                          dog = {
                            identity,
                            leash-length: float,
                          }

                          identity = (
                            age: int,
                            name: tstr,
                          )

                 Figure 6: Using a Group for Factorization

   Note that the lists inside the braces in the above definitions
   constitute (anonymous) groups, while &quot;identity&quot; is a named group,
   which can then be included as part of other groups (anonymous as in
   the example, or themselves named).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1.1" href="#section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>.  Usage</span>

   Groups are the instrument used in composing data structures with
   CDDL.  It is a matter of style in defining those structures whether
   to define groups (anonymously) right in their contexts or whether to
   define them in a separate rule and to reference them with their
   respective name (possibly more than once).

   With this, one is allowed to define all small parts of their data
   structures and compose bigger protocol data units with those or to
   have only one big protocol data unit that has all definitions ad hoc
   where needed.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1.2" href="#section-2.1.2">2.1.2</a>.  Syntax</span>

   The composition syntax is intended to be concise and easy to read:

   o  The start and end of a group can be marked by &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;.

   o  Definitions of entries inside of a group are noted as follows:
      _keytype =&gt; valuetype,_ (read &quot;keytype maps to valuetype&quot;).  The
      comma is actually optional (not just in the final entry), but it
      is considered good style to set it.  The double arrow can be
      replaced by a colon in the common case of directly using a text
      string or integer literal as a key; see <a href="#section-3.5.1">Section 3.5.1</a>.  This is
      also the common way of naming elements of an array just for
      documentation; see <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

   A basic entry consists of a _keytype_ and a _valuetype_, both of
   which are types (<a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>); this entry matches any name/value pair
   the name of which is in the keytype and the value of which is in the
   valuetype.

   A group defined as a sequence of group entries matches any sequence
   of name/value pairs that is composed by concatenation in order of
   what the entries match.

   A group definition can also contain choices between groups; see
   <a href="#section-2.2.2">Section 2.2.2</a>.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc8610">RFC 8610</a>                          CDDL                         June 2019</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Types</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2.1" href="#section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  Values</span>

   Values such as numbers and strings can be used in place of a type.
   (For instance, this is a very common thing to do for a key type,
   common enough that CDDL provides additional convenience syntax
   for this.)

   The value notation is based on the C language, but does not offer all
   the syntactic variations (see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for details).  The value
   notation for numbers inherits from C the distinction between integer
   values (no fractional part or exponent given -- NR1 [<a href="#ref-ISO6093" title="&quot;Information processing -- Representation of numerical values in character strings for information interchange&quot;">ISO6093</a>];
   &quot;NR&quot; stands for &quot;numerical representation&quot;) and floating-point values
   (where a fractional part, an exponent, or both are present -- NR2 or
   NR3), so the type &quot;1&quot; does not include any floating-point numbers
   while the types &quot;1e3&quot; and &quot;1.5&quot; are both floating-point numbers and
   do not include any integer numbers.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2.2" href="#section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  Choices</span>

   Many places that allow a type also allow a choice between types,
   delimited by a &quot;/&quot; (slash).  The entire choice construct can be put
   into parentheses if this is required to make the construction
   unambiguous (please see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for details of the CDDL grammar).

   Choices of values can be used to express enumerations:

            attire = &quot;bow tie&quot; / &quot;necktie&quot; / &quot;Internet attire&quot;
            protocol = 6 / 17

   Analogous to types, CDDL also allows choices between groups,
   delimited by a &quot;//&quot; (double slash).  Note that the &quot;//&quot; operator
   binds much more weakly than the other CDDL operators, so each line
   within &quot;delivery&quot; in the following example is its own alternative in
   the group choice:

                   address = { delivery }

                   delivery = (
                   street: tstr, ? number: uint, city //
                   po-box: uint, city //
                   per-pickup: true )

                   city = (
                   name: tstr, zip-code: uint
                   )




<span class="grey">Birkholz, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 11]</span></pre>

   A group choice matches the union of the sets of name/value pair
   sequences that the alternatives in the choice can.

   For both type choices and group choices, additional alternatives can
   be added to a rule later in separate rules by using &quot;/=&quot; and &quot;//=&quot;,
   respectively, instead of &quot;=&quot;:

                 attire /= &quot;swimwear&quot;

                 delivery //= (
                 lat: float, long: float, drone-type: tstr
                 )

   It is not an error if a name is first used with a &quot;/=&quot; or &quot;//=&quot;
   (there is no need to &quot;create it&quot; with &quot;=&quot;).

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2.2.1" href="#section-2.2.2.1">2.2.2.1</a>.  Ranges</span>

   Instead of naming all the values that make up a choice, CDDL allows
   building a _range_ out of two values that are in an ordering
   relationship: a lower bound (first value) and an upper bound (second
   value).  A range can be inclusive of both bounds given (denoted by
   joining two values by &quot;..&quot;), or it can include the lower bound and
   exclude the upper bound (denoted by instead using &quot;...&quot;).  If the
   lower bound exceeds the upper bound, the resulting type is the empty
   set (this behavior can be desirable when generics (<a href="#section-3.10">Section 3.10</a>) are
   being used).

         device-address = byte
         max-byte = 255
         byte = 0..max-byte ; inclusive range
         first-non-byte = 256
         byte1 = 0...first-non-byte ; byte1 is equivalent to byte

   CDDL currently only allows ranges between integers (matching integer
   values) or between floating-point values (matching floating-point
   values).  If both are needed in a type, a type choice between the two
   kinds of ranges can be (clumsily) used:

                int-range = 0..10 ; only integers match
                float-range = 0.0..10.0 ; only floats match
                BAD-range1 = 0..10.0 ; NOT DEFINED
                BAD-range2 = 0.0..10 ; NOT DEFINED
                numeric-range = int-range / float-range

   Note that the dot is a valid name continuation character in CDDL, so

      min..max

   is not a range expression but a single name.  When using a name as
   the left-hand side of a range operator, use spacing as in

      min .. max

   to separate off the range operator.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2.2.2" href="#section-2.2.2.2">2.2.2.2</a>.  Turning a Group into a Choice</span>

   Some choices are built out of large numbers of values, often
   integers, each of which is best given a semantic name in the
   specification.  Instead of naming each of these integers and then
   accumulating them into a choice, CDDL allows building a choice from a
   group by prefixing it with an &quot;&amp;&quot; character:

              terminal-color = &amp;basecolors
              basecolors = (
                black: 0,  red: 1,  green: 2,  yellow: 3,
                blue: 4,  magenta: 5,  cyan: 6,  white: 7,
              )
              extended-color = &amp;(
                basecolors,
                orange: 8,  pink: 9,  purple: 10,  brown: 11,
              )

   As with the use of groups in arrays (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>), the member names
   have only documentary value (in particular, they might be used by a
   tool when displaying integers that are taken from that choice).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2.3" href="#section-2.2.3">2.2.3</a>.  Representation Types</span>

   CDDL allows the specification of a data item type by referring to the
   CBOR representation (specifically, to major types and additional
   information; see <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of [RFC7049]</a>).  How this is used should be
   evident from the prelude (Appendix D): a hash mark (&quot;#&quot;) optionally
   followed by a number from 0 to 7 identifying the major type, which
   then can be followed by a dot and a number specifying the additional
   information.  This construction specifies the set of values that can
   be serialized in CBOR (i.e., &quot;any&quot;), by the given major type if one
   is given, or by the given major type with the additional information
   if both are given.  Where a major type of 6 (Tag) is used, the type
   of the tagged item can be specified by appending it in parentheses.

   Note that although this notation is based on the CBOR serialization,
   it is about a set of values at the data model level, e.g., &quot;#7.25&quot;
   specifies the set of values that can be represented as half-precision
   floats; it does not mandate that these values also do have to be
   serialized as half-precision floats: CDDL does not provide any
   language means to restrict the choice of serialization variants.
   This also enables the use of CDDL with JSON, which uses a
   fundamentally different way of serializing (some of) the same values.

   It may be necessary to make use of representation types outside the
   prelude, e.g., a specification could start by making use of an
   existing tag in a more specific way or could define a new tag not
   defined in the prelude:

      my_breakfast = #6.55799(breakfast)   ; cbor-any is too general!
      breakfast = cereal / porridge
      cereal = #6.998(tstr)
      porridge = #6.999([liquid, solid])
      liquid = milk / water
      milk = 0
      water = 1
      solid = tstr

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2.4" href="#section-2.2.4">2.2.4</a>.  Root Type</span>

   There is no special syntax to identify the root of a CDDL data
   structure definition: that role is simply taken by the first rule
   defined in the file.

   This is motivated by the usual top-down approach for defining data
   structures, decomposing a big data structure unit into smaller parts;
   however, except for the root type, there is no need to strictly
   follow this sequence.

   (Note that there is no way to use a group as a root -- it must be
   a type.)

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Syntax</span>

   In this section, the overall syntax of CDDL is shown, alongside some
   examples just illustrating syntax.  (The definition does not attempt
   to be overly formal; refer to <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for details.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  General Conventions</span>

   The basic syntax is inspired by ABNF [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5234" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>], with the following:

   o  Rules, whether they define groups or types, are defined with a
      name, followed by an equals sign &quot;=&quot; and the actual definition
      according to the respective syntactic rules of that definition.

   o  A name can consist of any of the characters from the set {&quot;A&quot; to
      &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z&quot;, &quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;$&quot;}, starting
      with an alphabetic character (including &quot;@&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, &quot;$&quot;) and ending
      in such a character or a digit.

      *  Names are case sensitive.

      *  It is preferred style to start a name with a lowercase letter.

      *  The hyphen is preferred over the underscore (except in a
         &quot;bareword&quot; (<a href="#section-3.5.1">Section 3.5.1</a>), where the semantics may actually
         require an underscore).

      *  The period may be useful for larger specifications, to express
         some module structure (as in &quot;tcp.throughput&quot; vs.
         &quot;udp.throughput&quot;).

      *  A number of names are predefined in the CDDL prelude, as listed
         in <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a>.

      *  Rule names (types or groups) do not appear in the actual CBOR
         encoding, but names used as &quot;barewords&quot; in member keys do.

   o  Comments are started by a &quot;;&quot; (semicolon) character and finish at
      the end of a line (LF or CRLF).

   o  Except within strings, whitespace (spaces, newlines, and comments)
      is used to separate syntactic elements for readability (and to
      separate identifiers, range operators, or numbers that follow each
      other); it is otherwise completely optional.

   o  Hexadecimal numbers are preceded by &quot;0x&quot; (without quotes) and are
      case insensitive.  Similarly, binary numbers are preceded by &quot;0b&quot;.




<span class="grey">Birkholz, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 15]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-16" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc8610">RFC 8610</a>                          CDDL                         June 2019</span>


   o  Text strings are enclosed by double quotation &#x27;&quot;&#x27; characters.
      They follow the conventions for strings as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8259#section-7">Section&nbsp;7 of
      [RFC8259]</a>.  (ABNF users may want to note that there is no support
      in CDDL for the concept of case insensitivity in text strings; if
      necessary, regular expressions can be used (<a href="#section-3.8.3">Section 3.8.3</a>).)

   o  Byte strings are enclosed by single quotation &quot;&#x27;&quot; characters and
      may be prefixed by &quot;h&quot; or &quot;b64&quot;.  If unprefixed, the string is
      interpreted as with a text string, except that single quotes must
      be escaped and that the resulting UTF-8 bytes are marked as a byte
      string (major type 2).  If prefixed as &quot;h&quot; or &quot;b64&quot;, the string is
      interpreted as a sequence of pairs of hex digits (base16; see
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc4648#section-8">Section&nbsp;8 of [RFC4648]</a>) or a base64(url) string (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> or
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5">Section&nbsp;5 of [RFC4648]</a>), respectively (as with the diagnostic
      notation in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049#section-6">Section&nbsp;6 of [RFC7049]</a>; cf. <a href="#appendix-G.2">Appendix G.2</a>); any
      whitespace present within the string (including comments) is
      ignored in the prefixed case.

   o  CDDL uses UTF-8 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3629" title="&quot;UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646&quot;">RFC3629</a>] for its encoding.  Processing of CDDL
      does not involve Unicode normalization processes.

   Example:

                    ; This is a comment
                    person = { g }

                    g = (
                      &quot;name&quot;: tstr,
                      age: int,  ; &quot;age&quot; is a bareword
                    )

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Occurrence</span>

   An optional _occurrence_ indicator can be given in front of a group
   entry.  It is either (1) one of the characters &quot;?&quot; (optional), &quot;*&quot;
   (zero or more), or &quot;+&quot; (one or more) or (2) of the form n*m, where n
   and m are optional unsigned integers and n is the lower limit
   (default 0) and m is the upper limit (default no limit) of
   occurrences.

   If no occurrence indicator is specified, the group entry is to occur
   exactly once (as if 1*1 were specified).  A group entry with an
   occurrence indicator matches sequences of name/value pairs that are
   composed by concatenating a number of sequences that the basic group
   entry matches, where the number needs to be allowed by the occurrence
   indicator.

   Note that CDDL, outside any directives/annotations that could
   possibly be defined, does not make any prescription as to whether
   arrays or maps use definite-length or indefinite-length encoding.
   That is, there is no correlation between leaving the size of an array
   &quot;open&quot; in the spec and the fact that it is then interchanged with
   definite or indefinite length.

   Please also note that CDDL can describe flexibility that the data
   model of the target representation does not have.  This is rather
   obvious for JSON but is also relevant for CBOR:

                           apartment = {
                             kitchen: size,
                             * bedroom: size,
                           }
                           size = float ; in m2

   The previous specification does not mean that CBOR is changed to
   allow using the key &quot;bedroom&quot; more than once.  In other words, due to
   the restrictions imposed by the data model, the third line pretty
   much turns into:

                             ? bedroom: size,

   (Occurrence indicators beyond one are still useful in maps for groups
   that allow a variety of keys.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Predefined Names for Types</span>

   CDDL predefines a number of names.  This subsection summarizes these
   names, but please see <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a> for the exact definitions.

   The following keywords for primitive datatypes are defined:

   &quot;bool&quot;  Boolean value (major type 7, additional information 20
      or 21).

   &quot;uint&quot;  An unsigned integer (major type 0).

   &quot;nint&quot;  A negative integer (major type 1).

   &quot;int&quot;  An unsigned integer or a negative integer.

   &quot;float16&quot;  A number representable as a half-precision float [<a href="#ref-IEEE754" title="&quot;IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic&quot;">IEEE754</a>]
      (major type 7, additional information 25).

   &quot;float32&quot;  A number representable as a single-precision float
      [<a href="#ref-IEEE754" title="&quot;IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic&quot;">IEEE754</a>] (major type 7, additional information 26).

   &quot;float64&quot;  A number representable as a double-precision float
      [<a href="#ref-IEEE754" title="&quot;IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic&quot;">IEEE754</a>] (major type 7, additional information 27).

   &quot;float&quot;  One of float16, float32, or float64.

   &quot;bstr&quot; or &quot;bytes&quot;  A byte string (major type 2).

   &quot;tstr&quot; or &quot;text&quot;  Text string (major type 3).

   (Note that there are no predefined names for arrays or maps; these
   are defined with the syntax given below.)

   In addition, a number of types are defined in the prelude that are
   associated with CBOR tags, such as &quot;tdate&quot;, &quot;bigint&quot;, &quot;regexp&quot;, etc.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Arrays</span>

   Array definitions surround a group with square brackets.

   For each entry, an occurrence indicator as specified in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>
   is permitted.

   For example:

                     unlimited-people = [* person]
                     one-or-two-people = [1*2 person]
                     at-least-two-people = [2* person]
                     person = (
                         name: tstr,
                         age: uint,
                     )

   The group &quot;person&quot; is defined in such a way that repeating it in the
   array each time generates alternating names and ages, so these are
   four valid values for a data item of type &quot;unlimited-people&quot;:

      [&quot;roundlet&quot;, 1047, &quot;psychurgy&quot;, 2204, &quot;extrarhythmical&quot;, 2231]
      []
      [&quot;aluminize&quot;, 212, &quot;climograph&quot;, 4124]
      [&quot;penintime&quot;, 1513, &quot;endocarditis&quot;, 4084, &quot;impermeator&quot;, 1669,
       &quot;coextension&quot;, 865]

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc8610">RFC 8610</a>                          CDDL                         June 2019</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Maps</span>

   The syntax for specifying maps merits special attention, as well as a
   number of optimizations and conveniences, as it is likely to be the
   focal point of many specifications employing CDDL.  While the syntax
   does not strictly distinguish struct and table usage of maps, it
   caters specifically to each of them.

   But first, let&#x27;s reiterate a feature of CBOR that it has inherited
   from JSON: the key/value pairs in CBOR maps have no fixed ordering.
   (One could imagine situations where fixing the ordering may be of
   use.  For example, a decoder could look for values related with
   integer keys 1, 3, and 7.  If the order were fixed and the decoder
   encounters the key 4 without having encountered key 3, it could
   conclude that key 3 is not available without doing more complicated
   bookkeeping.  Unfortunately, neither JSON nor CBOR supports this, so
   no attempt was made to support this in CDDL either.)

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.1" href="#section-3.5.1">3.5.1</a>.  Structs</span>

   The &quot;struct&quot; usage of maps is similar to the way JSON objects are
   used in many JSON applications.

   A map is defined in the same way as that for defining an array (see
   <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>), except for using curly braces &quot;{}&quot; instead of square
   brackets &quot;[]&quot;.

   An occurrence indicator as specified in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> is permitted for
   each group entry.

   The following is an example of a record with a structure embedded:

       Geography = [
         city           : tstr,
         gpsCoordinates : GpsCoordinates,
       ]

       GpsCoordinates = {
         longitude      : uint,            ; degrees, scaled by 10^7
         latitude       : uint,            ; degrees, scaled by 10^7
       }

   When encoding, the Geography record is encoded using a CBOR array
   with two members (the keys for the group entries are ignored),
   whereas the GpsCoordinates structure is encoded as a CBOR map with
   two key/value pairs.





<span class="grey">Birkholz, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 19]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc8610">RFC 8610</a>                          CDDL                         June 2019</span>


   Types used in a structure can be defined in separate rules or just in
   place (potentially placed inside parentheses, such as for choices).
   For example:

                           located-samples = {
                             sample-point: int,
                             samples: [+ float],
                           }

   where &quot;located-samples&quot; is the datatype to be used when referring to
   the struct, and &quot;sample-point&quot; and &quot;samples&quot; are the keys to be used.
   This is actually a complete example: an identifier that is followed
   by a colon can be directly used as the text string for a member key
   (we speak of a &quot;bareword&quot; member key), as can a double-quoted string
   or a number.  (When other types -- in particular, types that contain
   more than one value -- are used as the types of keys, they are
   followed by a double arrow; see below.)

   If a text string key does not match the syntax for an identifier (or
   if the specifier just happens to prefer using double quotes), the
   text string syntax can also be used in the member key position,
   followed by a colon.  The above example could therefore have been
   written with quoted strings in the member key positions.

   More generally, types specified in ways other than those listed for
   the cases described above can be used in a key-type position by
   following them with a double arrow -- in particular, the double arrow
   is necessary if a type is named by an identifier (which, when
   followed by a colon, would be interpreted as a &quot;bareword&quot; and turned
   into a text string).  A literal text string also gives rise to a type
   (which contains a single value only -- the given string), so another
   form for this example is:

                         located-samples = {

   See <a href="#section-3.5.4">Section 3.5.4</a> below for how the colon (&quot;:&quot;) shortcut described
   here also adds some implied semantics.

   A better way to demonstrate the use of the double arrow may be:

             located-samples = {
               sample-point: int,
               samples: [+ float],
               * equipment-type =&gt; equipment-tolerances,
             }
             equipment-type = [name: tstr, manufacturer: tstr]
             equipment-tolerances = [+ [float, float]]

   The example below defines a struct with optional entries: display
   name (as a text string), the name components first name and family
   name (as text strings), and age information (as an unsigned integer).

                          PersonalData = {
                            ? displayName: tstr,
                            NameComponents,
                            ? age: uint,
                          }

                          NameComponents = (
                            ? firstName: tstr,
                            ? familyName: tstr,
                          )

   Note that the group definition for NameComponents does not generate
   another map; instead, all four keys are directly in the struct built
   by PersonalData.

   In this example, all key/value pairs are optional from the
   perspective of CDDL.  With no occurrence indicator, an entry is
   mandatory.

   If the addition of more entries not specified by the current
   specification is desired, one can add this possibility explicitly:

                          PersonalData = {
                            ? displayName: tstr,
                            NameComponents,
                            ? age: uint,
                            * tstr =&gt; any
                          }

                          NameComponents = (
                            ? firstName: tstr,
                            ? familyName: tstr,
                          )

   The CDDL tool described in <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a> generated the following as one
   acceptable instance for this specification:

         {&quot;familyName&quot;: &quot;agust&quot;, &quot;antiforeignism&quot;: &quot;pretzel&quot;,
          &quot;springbuck&quot;: &quot;illuminatingly&quot;, &quot;exuviae&quot;: &quot;ephemeris&quot;,
          &quot;kilometrage&quot;: &quot;frogfish&quot;}

   (See <a href="#section-3.9">Section 3.9</a> for one way to explicitly identify an extension
   point.)

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.2" href="#section-3.5.2">3.5.2</a>.  Tables</span>

   A table can be specified by defining a map with entries where the
   key type allows more than just a single value; for example:

                         square-roots = {* x =&gt; y}
                         x = int
                         y = float

   Here, the key in each key/value pair has datatype x (defined as int),
   and the value has datatype y (defined as float).

   If the specification does not need to restrict one of x or y (i.e.,
   the application is free to choose per entry), it can be replaced by
   the predefined name &quot;any&quot;.

   As another example, the following could be used as a conversion table
   converting from an integer or float to a string:

                      tostring = {* mynumber =&gt; tstr}
                      mynumber = int / float

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.3" href="#section-3.5.3">3.5.3</a>.  Non-deterministic Order</span>

   While the way arrays are matched is fully determined by the PEG
   formalism (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>), matching is more complicated for maps, as
   maps do not have an inherent order.  For each candidate name/value
   pair that the PEG algorithm would try, a matching member is picked
   out of the entire map.  For certain group expressions, more than one
   member in the map may match.  Most often, this is inconsequential, as
   the group expression tends to consume all matches:

                            labeled-values = {
                              ? fritz: number,
                              * label =&gt; value
                            }
                            label = text
                            value = number

   Here, if any member with the key &quot;fritz&quot; is present, this will be
   picked by the first entry of the group; all remaining text/number
   members will be picked by the second entry (and if anything remains
   unpicked, the map does not match).

   However, it is possible to construct group expressions where what is
   actually picked is indeterminate, but does matter:

                            do-not-do-this = {
                              int =&gt; int,
                              int =&gt; 6,
                            }

   When this expression is matched against &quot;{3: 5, 4: 6}&quot;, the first
   group entry might pick off the &quot;3: 5&quot;, leaving &quot;4: 6&quot; for matching
   the second one.  Or it might pick off &quot;4: 6&quot;, leaving nothing for the
   second entry.  This pathological non-determinism is caused by
   specifying &quot;more general&quot; before &quot;more specific&quot; and by having a
   general rule that only consumes a subset of the map key/value pairs
   that it is able to match -- both tend not to occur in real-world
   specifications of maps.  At the time of writing, CDDL tools cannot
   detect such cases automatically, and for the present version of the
   CDDL specification, the specification writer is simply urged to not
   write pathologically non-deterministic specifications.

   (The astute reader will be reminded of what was called &quot;ambiguous
   content models&quot; in the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
   and &quot;non-deterministic content models&quot; in XML.  That problem is
   related to the one described here, but the problem here is
   specifically caused by the lack of order in maps, something that the
   XML schema languages do not have to contend with.  Note that
   RELAX NG&#x27;s &quot;interleave&quot; pattern handles lack of order explicitly on
   the specification side, while the instances in XML always have
   determinate order.)

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5.4" href="#section-3.5.4">3.5.4</a>.  Cuts in Maps</span>

   The extensibility idiom discussed above for structs has one problem:

                        extensible-map-example = {
                          ? &quot;optional-key&quot; =&gt; int,
                          * tstr =&gt; any
                        }

   In this example, there is one optional key &quot;optional-key&quot;, which,
   when present, maps to an integer.  There is also a wildcard for any
   future additions.

   Unfortunately, the data item

                      { &quot;optional-key&quot;: &quot;nonsense&quot; }

   does match this specification: while the first entry of the group
   does not match, the second one (the wildcard) does.  This may very
   well be desirable (e.g., if a future extension is to be allowed to
   extend the type of &quot;optional-key&quot;), but in many cases it isn&#x27;t.

   In anticipation of a more general potential feature called &quot;cuts&quot;,
   CDDL allows inserting a cut &quot;^&quot; into the definition of the map entry:

                       extensible-map-example = {
                         ? &quot;optional-key&quot; ^ =&gt; int,
                         * tstr =&gt; any
                       }

   A cut in this position means that once the member key matches the
   name part of an entry that carries a cut, other potential matches for
   the key of the member that occur in later entries in the group of the
   map are no longer allowed.  In other words, when a group entry would
   pick a key/value pair based on just a matching key, it &quot;locks in&quot; the
   pick -- this rule applies, independently of whether the value matches





<span class="grey">Birkholz, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 24]</span></pre>

   as well, so when it does not, the entire map fails to match.  In
   summary, the example above no longer matches the specification as
   modified with the cut.

   Since the desire for this kind of exclusive matching is so frequent,
   the &quot;:&quot; shortcut is actually defined to include the cut semantics.
   So, the preceding example (including the cut) can be written more
   simply as:

                        extensible-map-example = {
                          ? &quot;optional-key&quot;: int,
                          * tstr =&gt; any
                        }

   or even shorter, using a bareword for the key:

                        extensible-map-example = {
                          ? optional-key: int,
                          * tstr =&gt; any
                        }

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.6" href="#section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Tags</span>

   A type can make use of a CBOR tag (major type 6) by using the
   representation type notation, giving #6.nnn(type) where nnn is an
   unsigned integer giving the tag number and &quot;type&quot; is the type of the
   data item being tagged.

   For example, the following line from the CDDL prelude (Appendix D)
   defines &quot;biguint&quot; as a type name for an unsigned bignum N:

                           biguint = #6.2(bstr)

   The tags defined by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] are included in the prelude.
   Additional tags registered since [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] was written need to be
   added to a CDDL specification as needed; e.g., a binary Universally
   Unique Identifier (UUID) tag could be referenced as &quot;buuid&quot; in a
   specification after defining

                            buuid = #6.37(bstr)

   In the following example, usage of tag 32 for URIs is optional:

                        my_uri = #6.32(tstr) / tstr

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.7" href="#section-3.7">3.7</a>.  Unwrapping</span>

   The group that is used to define a map or an array can often be
   reused in the definition of another map or array.  Similarly, a type
   defined as a tag carries an internal data item that one would like to
   refer to.  In these cases, it is expedient to simply use the name of
   the map, array, or tag type as a handle for the group or type defined
   inside it.

   The &quot;unwrap&quot; operator (written by preceding a name by a tilde
   character &quot;~&quot;) can be used to strip the type defined for a name by
   one layer, exposing the underlying group (for maps and arrays) or
   type (for tags).

   For example, an application might want to define a basic header and
   an advanced header.  Without unwrapping, this might be done as
   follows:

             basic-header-group = (
               field1: int,
               field2: text,
             )

             basic-header = [ basic-header-group ]

             advanced-header = [
               basic-header-group,
               field3: bytes,
               field4: number, ; as in the tagged type &quot;time&quot;
             ]

   Unwrapping simplifies this to:

                            basic-header = [
                              field1: int,
                              field2: text,
                            ]

                            advanced-header = [
                              ~basic-header,
                              field3: bytes,
                              field4: ~time,
                            ]

   (Note that leaving out the first unwrap operator in the latter
   example would lead to nesting the basic-header in its own array
   inside the advanced-header, while, with the unwrapped basic-header,
   the definition of the group inside basic-header is essentially

   repeated inside advanced-header, leading to a single array.  This can
   be used for various applications often solved by inheritance in
   programming languages.  The effect of unwrapping can also be
   described as &quot;threading in&quot; the group or type inside the referenced
   type, which suggested the thread-like &quot;~&quot; character.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8" href="#section-3.8">3.8</a>.  Controls</span>

   A _control_ allows relating a _target_ type with a _controller_ type
   via a _control operator_.

   The syntax for a control type is &quot;target .control-operator
   controller&quot;, where control operators are special identifiers prefixed
   by a dot.  (Note that _target_ or _controller_ might need to be
   parenthesized.)

   A number of control operators are defined at this point.  Further
   control operators may be defined by new versions of this
   specification or by registering them according to the procedures in
   <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.1" href="#section-3.8.1">3.8.1</a>.  Control Operator .size</span>

   A &quot;.size&quot; control controls the size of the target in bytes by the
   control type.  The control is defined for text and byte strings,
   where it directly controls the number of bytes in the string.  It is
   also defined for unsigned integers (see below).  Figure 8 shows
   example usage for byte strings.

                   full-address = [[+ label], ip4, ip6]
                   ip4 = bstr .size 4
                   ip6 = bstr .size 16
                   label = bstr .size (1..63)

                    Figure 8: Control for Size in Bytes

   When applied to an unsigned integer, the &quot;.size&quot; control restricts
   the range of that integer by giving a maximum number of bytes that
   should be needed in a computer representation of that unsigned
   integer.  In other words, &quot;uint .size N&quot; is equivalent to
   &quot;0...BYTES_N&quot;, where BYTES_N == 256**N.

     audio_sample = uint .size 3 ; 24-bit, equivalent to 0...<a href="#page-16777216">16777216</a>

   Note that, as with value restrictions in CDDL, this control is not a
   representation constraint; a number that fits into fewer bytes can
   still be represented in that form, and an inefficient implementation
   could use a longer form (unless that is restricted by some format
   constraints outside of CDDL, such as the rules in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049#section-3.9">Section&nbsp;3.9 of

   A &quot;.bits&quot; control on a byte string indicates that, in the target,
   only the bits numbered by a number in the control type are allowed to
   be set.  (Bits are counted the usual way, bit number &quot;n&quot; being set in
   &quot;str&quot; meaning that &quot;(str[n &gt;&gt; 3] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (n &amp; 7))) != 0&quot;.)
   Similarly, a &quot;.bits&quot; control on an unsigned integer &quot;i&quot; indicates
   that for all unsigned integers &quot;n&quot; where &quot;(i &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; n)) != 0&quot;, &quot;n&quot;
   must be in the control type.

   The CDDL tool described in <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a> generates the following ten
   example instances for &quot;tcpflagbytes&quot;:

      h&#x27;906d&#x27; h&#x27;01fc&#x27; h&#x27;8145&#x27; h&#x27;01b7&#x27; h&#x27;013d&#x27; h&#x27;409f&#x27; h&#x27;018e&#x27; h&#x27;c05f&#x27;
      h&#x27;01fa&#x27; h&#x27;01fe&#x27;

   These examples do not illustrate that the above CDDL specification
   does not explicitly specify a size of two bytes: a valid all-clear
   instance of flag bytes could be &quot;h&#x27;&#x27;&quot; or &quot;h&#x27;00&#x27;&quot; or even &quot;h&#x27;000000&#x27;&quot;
   as well.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.3" href="#section-3.8.3">3.8.3</a>.  Control Operator .regexp</span>

   A &quot;.regexp&quot; control indicates that the text string given as a target
   needs to match the XML Schema Definition (XSD) regular expression
   given as a value in the control type.  XSD regular expressions are
   defined in <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a> of [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028">W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028</a>].

     nai = tstr .regexp &quot;[A-Za-z0-9]+@[A-Za-z0-9]+(\\.[A-Za-z0-9]+)+&quot;

   An example matching this regular expression:

                       &quot;N1@CH57HF.4Znqe0.dYJRN.igjf&quot;

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.3.1" href="#section-3.8.3.1">3.8.3.1</a>.  Usage Considerations</span>

   Note that XSD regular expressions do not support the usual \x or \u
   escapes for hexadecimal expression of bytes or Unicode code points.
   However, in CDDL the XSD regular expressions are contained in text
   strings, the literal notation for which provides \u escapes; this
   should suffice for most applications that use regular expressions for
   text strings.  (Note that this also means that there is one level of
   string escaping before the XSD escaping rules are applied.)

   XSD regular expressions support character class subtraction, a
   feature often not found in regular expression libraries;
   specification writers may want to use this feature sparingly.
   Similar considerations apply to Unicode character classes; where
   these are used, the specification that employs CDDL SHOULD identify
   which Unicode versions are addressed.

   Other surprises for infrequent users of XSD regular expressions may
   include the following:

   o  No direct support for case insensitivity.  While case
      insensitivity has gone mostly out of fashion in protocol design,
      it is sometimes needed and then needs to be expressed manually as
      in &quot;[Cc][Aa][Ss][Ee]&quot;.

   o  The support for popular character classes such as \w and \d is
      based on Unicode character properties; this is often not what is
      desired in an ASCII-based protocol and thus might lead to
      surprises.  (\s and \S do have their more conventional meanings,
      and &quot;.&quot; matches any character but the line-ending characters \r
      or \n.)

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.3.2" href="#section-3.8.3.2">3.8.3.2</a>.  Discussion</span>

   There are many flavors of regular expression in use in the
   programming community.  For instance, Perl-Compatible Regular
   Expressions (PCREs) are widely used and probably are more useful than
   XSD regular expressions.  However, there is no normative reference
   for PCREs that could be used in the present document.  Instead, we
   opt for XSD regular expressions for now.  There is precedent for that
   choice in the IETF, e.g., in YANG [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7950" title="&quot;The YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language&quot;">RFC7950</a>].

   Note that CDDL uses controls as its main extension point.  This
   creates the opportunity to add further regular expression formats in
   addition to the one referenced here, if desired.  As an example, a
   proposal for a &quot;.pcre&quot; control is defined in [<a href="#ref-CDDL-Freezer">CDDL-Freezer</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.4" href="#section-3.8.4">3.8.4</a>.  Control Operators .cbor and .cborseq</span>

   A &quot;.cbor&quot; control on a byte string indicates that the byte string
   carries a CBOR-encoded data item.  Decoded, the data item matches the
   type given as the right-hand-side argument (type1 in the following
   example).

      &quot;bytes .cbor type1&quot;

   Similarly, a &quot;.cborseq&quot; control on a byte string indicates that the
   byte string carries a sequence of CBOR-encoded data items.  When the
   data items are taken as an array, the array matches the type given as
   the right-hand-side argument (type2 in the following example).

      &quot;bytes .cborseq type2&quot;

   (The conversion of the encoded sequence to an array can be effected,
   for instance, by wrapping the byte string between the two bytes 0x9f
   and 0xff and decoding the wrapped byte string as a CBOR-encoded
   data item.)

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.5" href="#section-3.8.5">3.8.5</a>.  Control Operators .within and .and</span>

   A &quot;.and&quot; control on a type indicates that the data item matches both
   the left-hand-side type and the type given as the right-hand side.
   (Formally, the resulting type is the intersection of the two types
   given.)

      &quot;type1 .and type2&quot;







<span class="grey">Birkholz, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 30]</span></pre>

   A variant of the &quot;.and&quot; control is the &quot;.within&quot; control, which
   expresses an additional intent: the left-hand-side type is meant to
   be a subset of the right-hand-side type.

      &quot;type1 .within type2&quot;

   While both forms have the identical formal semantics (intersection),
   the intention of the &quot;.within&quot; form is that the right-hand side gives
   guidance to the types allowed on the left-hand side, which typically
   is a socket (<a href="#section-3.9">Section 3.9</a>):

        message = $message .within message-structure
        message-structure = [message_type, *message_option]
        message_type = 0..255
        message_option = any

        $message /= [3, dough: text, topping: [* text]]
        $message /= [4, noodles: text, sauce: text, parmesan: bool]

   For &quot;.within&quot;, a tool might flag an error if type1 allows data items
   that are not allowed by type2.  In contrast, for &quot;.and&quot;, there is no
   expectation that type1 is already a subset of type2.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.8.6" href="#section-3.8.6">3.8.6</a>.  Control Operators .lt, .le, .gt, .ge, .eq, .ne, and .default</span>

   The controls .lt, .le, .gt, .ge, .eq, and .ne specify a constraint
   on the left-hand-side type to be a value less than, less than or
   equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, equal to, or not
   equal to a value given as a right-hand-side type (containing just
   that single value).  In the present specification, the first four
   controls (.lt, .le, .gt, and .ge) are defined only for numeric types,
   as these have a natural ordering relationship.

                     speed = number .ge 0  ; unit: m/s

   .ne and .eq are defined for both numeric values and values of other
   types.  If one of the values is not of a numeric type, equality is
   determined as follows: text strings are equal (satisfy .eq / do not
   satisfy .ne) if they are bytewise identical; the same applies for
   byte strings.  Arrays are equal if they have the same number of
   elements, all of which are equal pairwise in order between the
   arrays.  Maps are equal if they have the same number of key/value
   pairs, and there is pairwise equality between the key/value pairs
   between the two maps.  Tagged values are equal if they both have the
   same tag and the values are equal.  Values of simple types match if
   they are the same values.  Numeric types that occur within arrays,

   maps, or tagged values are equal if their numeric value is equal and
   they are both integers or both floating-point values.  All other
   cases are not equal (e.g., comparing a text string with a byte
   string).

   A variant of the &quot;.ne&quot; control is the &quot;.default&quot; control, which
   expresses an additional intent: the value specified by the
   right-hand-side type is intended as a default value for the
   left-hand-side type given, and the implied .ne control is there to
   prevent this value from being sent over the wire.  This control is
   only meaningful when the control type is used in an optional context;
   otherwise, there would be no way to make use of the default value.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.9" href="#section-3.9">3.9</a>.  Socket/Plug</span>

   For both type choices and group choices, a mechanism is defined that
   facilitates starting out with empty choices and assembling them
   later, potentially in separate files that are concatenated to build
   the full specification.

   Per convention, CDDL extension points are marked with a leading
   dollar sign (types) or two leading dollar signs (groups).  Tools
   honor that convention by not raising an error if such a type or group
   is not defined at all; the symbol is then taken to be an empty type
   choice (group choice), i.e., no choice is available.

            tcp-header = {seq: uint, ack: uint, * $$tcp-option}

            ; later, in a different file

            $$tcp-option //= (
            sack: [+(left: uint, right: uint)]
            )

            ; and, maybe in another file

            $$tcp-option //= (
            sack-permitted: true
            )

   Names that start with a single &quot;$&quot; are &quot;type sockets&quot;, starting out
   as an empty type, and intended to be extended via &quot;/=&quot;.  Names that
   start with a double &quot;$$&quot; are &quot;group sockets&quot;, starting out as an

   empty group choice, and intended to be extended via &quot;//=&quot;.  In either
   case, it is not an error if there is no definition for a socket at
   all; this then means there is no way to satisfy the rule (i.e., the
   choice is empty).

   As a convention, all definitions (plugs) for socket names must be
   augmentations, i.e., they must be using &quot;/=&quot; and &quot;//=&quot;, respectively.

   To pick up the example illustrated in Figure 7, the socket/plug
   mechanism could be used as shown in Figure 12:

                     PersonalData = {
                       ? displayName: tstr,
                       NameComponents,
                       ? age: uint,
                       * $$personaldata-extensions
                     }

                     NameComponents = (
                       ? firstName: tstr,
                       ? familyName: tstr,
                     )

                     ; The above already works as is.
                     ; But then, we can add later:

                     $$personaldata-extensions //= (
                       favorite-salsa: tstr,
                     )

                     ; and again, somewhere else:

                       shoesize: uint,

   Using angle brackets, the left-hand side of a rule can add formal
   parameters after the name being defined, as in:

      messages = message&lt;&quot;reboot&quot;, &quot;now&quot;&gt; / message&lt;&quot;sleep&quot;, 1..100&gt;
      message&lt;t, v&gt; = {type: t, value: v}

   When using a generic rule, the formal parameters are bound to the
   actual arguments supplied (also using angle brackets), within the
   scope of the generic rule (as if there were a rule of the form
   parameter = argument).

   Generic rules can be used for establishing names for both types and
   groups.

   (At this time, there are some limitations to the nesting of generics
   in the CDDL tool described in <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a>.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.11" href="#section-3.11">3.11</a>.  Operator Precedence</span>

   As with any language that has multiple syntactic features such as
   prefix and infix operators, CDDL has operators that bind more tightly
   than others.  This is becoming more complicated than, say, in ABNF,
   as CDDL has both types and groups, with operators that are specific
   to these concepts.  Type operators (such as &quot;/&quot; for type choice)
   operate on types, while group operators (such as &quot;//&quot; for group
   choice) operate on groups.  Types can simply be used in groups, but
   groups need to be bracketed (as arrays or maps) to become types.  So,
   type operators naturally bind closer than group operators.

   For instance, in

      t = [group1]
      group1 = (a / b // c / d)
      a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 d = 4

   group1 is a group choice between the type choice of a and b and the
   type choice of c and d.  This becomes more relevant once member keys
   and/or occurrences are added in:

      t = {group2}
      group2 = (? ab: a / b // cd: c / d)
      a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 d = 4

   is a group choice between the optional member &quot;ab&quot; of type a or b and
   the member &quot;cd&quot; of type c or d.  Note that the optionality is
   attached to the first choice (&quot;ab&quot;), not to the second choice.

   Similarly, in

      t = [group3]
      group3 = (+ a / b / c)
      a = 1 b = 2 c = 3

   group3 is a repetition of a type choice between a, b, and c; if just
   a is to be repeatable, a group choice is needed to focus the
   occurrence:

      t = [group4]
      group4 = (+ a // b / c)
      a = 1 b = 2 c = 3

   group4 is a group choice between a repeatable a and a single b or c.

   A comment has been that the semantics of group3 could be
   counterintuitive.  In general, as with many other languages with
   operator precedence rules, the specification writer is encouraged not
   to rely on them, but to insert parentheses liberally to guide readers
   that are not familiar with CDDL precedence rules:

      t = [group4a]
      group4a = ((+ a) // (b / c))
      a = 1 b = 2 c = 3

   The operator precedences, in sequence of loose to tight binding, are
   defined in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> and summarized in Table 1.  (Arities given are
   1 for unary prefix operators and 2 for binary infix operators.)

   In this section, we discuss several potential ways to employ CDDL.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  As a Guide for a Human User</span>

   CDDL can be used to efficiently define the layout of CBOR data, such
   that a human implementer can easily see how data is supposed to be
   encoded.

   Since CDDL maps parts of the CBOR data to human-readable names, tools
   could be built that use CDDL to provide a human-friendly
   representation of the CBOR data and allow them to edit such data
   while remaining compliant with its CDDL definition.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  For Automated Checking of CBOR Data Structures</span>

   CDDL has been specified such that a machine can handle the CDDL
   definition and related CBOR data (and, thus, also JSON data).  For
   example, a machine could use CDDL to check whether or not CBOR data
   is compliant with its definition.

   The need for thoroughness of such compliance checking depends on the
   application.  For example, an application may decide not to check the
   data structure at all and use the CDDL definition solely as a means
   to indicate the structure of the data to the programmer.

   On the other hand, the application may also implement a checking
   mechanism that goes as far as checking that all mandatory map members
   are available.

   The matter of how far the data description must be enforced by an
   application is left to the designers and implementers of that
   application, keeping in mind related security considerations.

   In no case is it intended that a CDDL tool would be &quot;writing code&quot;
   for an implementation.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  For Data Analysis Tools</span>

   In the long run, it can be expected that more and more data will be
   stored using the CBOR data format.

   Where there is data, there is data analysis and the need to process
   such data automatically.  CDDL can be used for such automated data
   processing, allowing tools to verify data, clean it, and extract
   particular parts of interest from it.

   Since CBOR is designed with constrained devices in mind, a likely use
   of it would be small sensors.  An interesting use would thus be
   automated analysis of sensor data.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document presents a content rules language for expressing CBOR
   data structures.  As such, it does not bring any security issues on
   itself, although specifications of protocols that use CBOR naturally
   need security analyses when defined.  General guidelines for writing
   security considerations are defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3552" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations&quot;">RFC3552</a>] (<a href="/doc/html/bcp72">BCP 72</a>).
   Specifications using CDDL to define CBOR structures in protocols need
   to follow those guidelines.  Additional topics that could be
   considered in a security considerations section for a specification
   that uses CDDL to define CBOR structures include the following:

   o  Where could the language maybe cause confusion in a way that will
      enable security issues?

   o  Where a CDDL matcher is part of the implementation of a system,
      the security of the system ought not depend on the correctness of
      the CDDL specification or CDDL implementation without any further
      defenses in place.

   o  Where the CDDL specification includes extension points, the impact
      of extensions on the security of the system needs to be carefully
      considered.

   Writers of CDDL specifications are strongly encouraged to value
   clarity and transparency of the specification over its elegance.
   Keep it as simple as possible while still expressing the needed data
   model.

   A related observation about formal description techniques in general
   that is strongly recommended to be kept in mind by writers of CDDL
   specifications: just because CDDL makes it easier to handle
   complexity in a specification, that does not make that complexity
   somehow less bad (except maybe on the level of the humans having to
   grasp the complex structure while reading the spec).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  CDDL Control Operators Registry</span>

   IANA has created a registry for control operators (<a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>).  The
   &quot;CDDL Control Operators&quot; registry has been created within the
   &quot;Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)&quot; registry.

   Each entry in the subregistry must include the name of the control
   operator (by convention given with the leading dot) and a reference
   to its documentation.  Names must be composed of the leading dot
   followed by a text string conforming to the production &quot;id&quot; in
   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

   All other control operator names are Unassigned.

   The IANA policy for additions to this registry is &quot;Specification
   Required&quot; as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] (which involves an Expert Review)
   for names that do not include an internal dot and &quot;IETF Review&quot; for
   names that do include an internal dot.  The expert reviewer is
   specifically instructed that other Standards Development
   Organizations (SDOs) may want to define control operators that are
   specific to their fields (e.g., based on a binary syntax already in
   use at the SDO); the review process should strive to facilitate such
   an undertaking.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs)</span>

   This appendix is normative.

   Since the 1950s, many grammar notations are based on Backus-Naur Form
   (BNF), a notation for context-free grammars (CFGs) within Chomsky&#x27;s
   generative system of grammars.  The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5234" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>], widely used in IETF specifications and also inspiring the
   syntax of CDDL, is an example of this.

   Generative grammars can express ambiguity well, but this very
   property may make them hard to use in recognition systems, spawning a
   number of subdialects that pose constraints on generative grammars to
   be used with parser generators; this scenario may be hard for the
   specification writer to manage.

   PEGs [<a href="#ref-PEG" title="&quot;Parsing expression grammars: a recognition- based syntactic foundation&quot;">PEG</a>] provide an alternative formal foundation for describing
   grammars that emphasizes recognition over generation and resolves
   what would have been ambiguity in generative systems by introducing
   the concept of &quot;prioritized choice&quot;.

   The notation for PEGs is quite close to BNF, with the usual &quot;Extended
   BNF&quot; features, such as repetition, added.  However, where BNF uses
   the unordered (symmetrical) choice operator &quot;|&quot; (incidentally notated
   as &quot;/&quot; in ABNF), PEG provides a prioritized choice operator &quot;/&quot;.  The
   two alternatives listed are to be tested in left-to-right order,
   locking in the first successful match and disregarding any further
   potential matches within the choice (but not disabling alternatives
   in choices containing this choice, as a cut (<a href="#section-3.5.4">Section 3.5.4</a>) would).

   For example, the ABNF expressions

      A = &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; / &quot;a&quot;    (1)

   and

      A = &quot;a&quot; / &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;    (2)

   are equivalent in ABNF&#x27;s original generative framework but are very
   different in PEG: in (2), the second alternative will never match, as
   any input string starting with an &quot;a&quot; will already succeed in the
   first alternative, locking in the match.

   Similarly, the occurrence indicators (&quot;?&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;+&quot;) are &quot;greedy&quot; in
   PEG, i.e., they consume as much input as they match (and, as a
   consequence, &quot;a* a&quot; in PEG notation or &quot;*a a&quot; in CDDL syntax never
   can match anything, as all input matching &quot;a&quot; is already consumed by
   the initial &quot;a*&quot;, leaving nothing to match the second &quot;a&quot;).

   Incidentally, the grammar of CDDL itself, as written in ABNF in
   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>, can be interpreted both (1) in the generative framework
   on which <a href="/doc/html/rfc5234">RFC 5234</a> is based and (2) as a PEG.  This was made possible
   by ordering the choices in the grammar such that a successful match
   made on the left-hand side of a &quot;/&quot; operator is always the intended
   match, instead of relying on the power of symmetrical choices (for
   example, note the sequence of alternatives in the rule for &quot;uint&quot;,
   where the lone zero is behind the longer match alternatives that
   start with a zero).

   The syntax used for expressing the PEG component of CDDL is based on
   ABNF, interpreted in the obvious way with PEG semantics.  The ABNF
   convention of notating occurrence indicators before the controlled
   primary, and of allowing numeric values for minimum and maximum
   occurrence around a &quot;*&quot; sign, is copied.  While PEG is only about
   characters, CDDL has a richer set of elements, such as types and
   groups.  Specifically, the following constructs map:

       +-------+-------+-------------------------------------------+
       | CDDL  | PEG   | Remark                                    |
       +-------+-------+-------------------------------------------+
       | &quot;=&quot;   | &quot;&lt;-&quot;  | /= and //= are abbreviations              |
       | &quot;//&quot;  | &quot;/&quot;   | prioritized choice                        |
       | &quot;/&quot;   | &quot;/&quot;   | prioritized choice, limited to types only |
       | &quot;?&quot; P | P &quot;?&quot; | zero or one                               |
       | &quot;*&quot; P | P &quot;*&quot; | zero or more                              |
       | &quot;+&quot; P | P &quot;+&quot; | one or more                               |
       | A B   | A B   | sequence                                  |
       | A, B  | A B   | sequence, comma is decoration only        |
       +-------+-------+-------------------------------------------+

   The literal notation and the use of square brackets, curly braces,
   tildes, ampersands, and hash marks are specific to CDDL and unrelated
   to the conventional PEG notation.  The DOT (&quot;.&quot;) from PEG is replaced
   by the unadorned &quot;#&quot; or its alias &quot;any&quot;.  Also, CDDL does not provide
   the syntactic predicate operators NOT (&quot;!&quot;) or AND (&quot;&amp;&quot;) from PEG,
   reducing expressiveness as well as complexity.

   For more details about PEG&#x27;s theoretical foundation and interesting
   properties of the operators such as associativity and distributivity,
   the reader is referred to [<a href="#ref-PEG" title="&quot;Parsing expression grammars: a recognition- based syntactic foundation&quot;">PEG</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C" href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  Matching Rules</span>

   This appendix is normative.

   In this appendix, we go through the ABNF syntax rules defined in
   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> and briefly describe the matching semantics of each
   syntactic feature.  In this context, an instance (data item)
   &quot;matches&quot; a CDDL specification if it is allowed by the CDDL
   specification; this is then broken down into parts of specifications
   (type and group expressions) and parts of instances (data items).

   cddl = S 1*(rule S)

   A CDDL specification is a sequence of one or more rules.  Each rule
   gives a name to a right-hand-side expression, either a CDDL type or a
   CDDL group.  Rule names can be used in the rule itself and/or other
   rules (and tools can output warnings if that is not the case).  The
   order of the rules is significant only in two cases:

   1.  The first rule defines the semantics of the entire specification;
       hence, there is no need to give that root rule a special name or
       special syntax in the language (as, for example, with &quot;start&quot; in
       RELAX NG); its name can therefore be chosen to be descriptive.
       (As with all other rule names, the name of the initial rule may
       be used in itself or in other rules.)

   2.  Where a rule contributes to a type or group choice (using &quot;/=&quot; or
       &quot;//=&quot;), that choice is populated in the order the rules are
       given; see below.

   rule = typename [genericparm] S assignt S type
        / groupname [genericparm] S assigng S grpent

   typename = id
   groupname = id

   A rule defines a name for a type expression (production &quot;type&quot;) or
   for a group expression (production &quot;grpent&quot;), with the intention that
   the semantics does not change when the name is replaced by its
   (parenthesized if needed) definition.  Note that whether the name
   defined by a rule stands for a type or a group isn&#x27;t always
   determined by syntax alone: e.g., &quot;a = b&quot; can make &quot;a&quot; a type if &quot;b&quot;
   is a type, or a group if &quot;b&quot; is a group.  More subtly, in &quot;a = (b)&quot;,
   &quot;a&quot; may be used as a type if &quot;b&quot; is a type, or as a group both when
   &quot;b&quot; is a group and when &quot;b&quot; is a type (a good convention to make the
   latter case stand out to the human reader is to write &quot;a = (b,)&quot;).
   (Note that the same dual meaning of parentheses applies within an
   expression but often can be resolved by the context of the
   parenthesized expression.  On the more general point, it may not be
   clear immediately either whether &quot;b&quot; stands for a group or a type --
   this semantic processing may need to span several levels of rule
   definitions before a determination can be made.)

   assignt = &quot;=&quot; / &quot;/=&quot;
   assigng = &quot;=&quot; / &quot;//=&quot;

   A plain equals sign defines the rule name as the equivalent of the
   expression to the right; it is an error if the name was already
   defined with a different expression.  A &quot;/=&quot; or &quot;//=&quot; extends a named
   type or a group by additional choices; a number of these could be
   replaced by collecting all the right-hand sides and creating a single
   rule with a type choice or a group choice built from the right-hand
   sides in the order of the rules given.  (It is not an error to extend
   a rule name that has not yet been defined; this makes the right-hand
   side the first entry in the choice being created.)

   genericparm = &quot;&lt;&quot; S id S *(&quot;,&quot; S id S ) &quot;&gt;&quot;
   genericarg = &quot;&lt;&quot; S type1 S *(&quot;,&quot; S type1 S ) &quot;&gt;&quot;

   Rule names can have generic parameters, which cause temporary
   assignments within the right-hand sides to the parameter names from
   the arguments given when citing the rule name.

   type = type1 *(S &quot;/&quot; S type1)

   A type can be given as a choice between one or more types.  The
   choice matches a data item if the data item matches any one of the
   types given in the choice.  The choice uses PEG semantics as
   discussed in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>: the first choice that matches wins.  (As a
   result, the order of rules that contribute to a single rule name can
   very well matter.)

   type1 = type2 [S (rangeop / ctlop) S type2]

   Two types can be combined with a range operator (see below) or a
   control operator (see <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>).

   type2 = value

   A type can be just a single value (such as 1 or &quot;icecream&quot; or
   h&#x27;0815&#x27;), which matches only a data item with that specific value (no
   conversions defined),

      / typename [genericarg]

   or be defined by a rule giving a meaning to a name (possibly after
   supplying generic arguments as required by the generic parameters),

      / &quot;(&quot; S type S &quot;)&quot;

   or be defined in a parenthesized type expression (parentheses may be
   necessary to override some operator precedence), or

      / &quot;{&quot; S group S &quot;}&quot;

   a map expression, which matches a valid CBOR map the key/value pairs
   of which can be ordered in such a way that the resulting sequence
   matches the group expression, or

      / &quot;[&quot; S group S &quot;]&quot;

   an array expression, which matches a CBOR array the elements of which
   -- when taken as values and complemented by a wildcard (matches
   anything) key each -- match the group, or

      / &quot;~&quot; S typename [genericarg]

   an &quot;unwrapped&quot; group (see <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>), which matches the group
   inside a type defined as a map or an array by wrapping the group, or

      / &quot;&amp;&quot; S &quot;(&quot; S group S &quot;)&quot;
      / &quot;&amp;&quot; S groupname [genericarg]

   an enumeration expression, which matches any value that is within the
   set of values that the values of the group given can take, or

      / &quot;#&quot; &quot;6&quot; [&quot;.&quot; uint] &quot;(&quot; S type S &quot;)&quot;

   a tagged data item, tagged with the &quot;uint&quot; given and containing the
   type given as the tagged value, or

      / &quot;#&quot; DIGIT [&quot;.&quot; uint]                ; major/ai

   a data item of a major type (given by the DIGIT), optionally
   constrained to the additional information given by the uint, or

      / &quot;#&quot;                                 ; any

   any data item.

   rangeop = &quot;...&quot; / &quot;..&quot;

   A range operator can be used to join two type expressions that stand
   for either two integer values or two floating-point values; it
   matches any value that is between the two values, where the first
   value is always included in the matching set and the second value is
   included for &quot;..&quot; and excluded for &quot;...&quot;.

   ctlop = &quot;.&quot; id

   A control operator ties a _target_ type to a _controller_ type as
   defined in <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>.  Note that control operators are an extension
   point for CDDL; additional documents may want to define additional
   control operators.

   group = grpchoice *(S &quot;//&quot; S grpchoice)

   A group matches any sequence of key/value pairs that matches any of
   the choices given (again using PEG semantics).

   grpchoice = *(grpent optcom)

   Each of the component groups is given as a sequence of group entries.
   For a match, the sequence of key/value pairs given needs to match the
   sequence of group entries in the sequence given.

   grpent = [occur S] [memberkey S] type

   A group entry can be given by a value type, which needs to be matched
   by the value part of a single element; and, optionally, a memberkey
   type, which needs to be matched by the key part of the element, if

   the memberkey is given.  If the memberkey is not given, the entry can
   only be used for matching arrays, not for maps.  (See below for how
   that is modified by the occurrence indicator.)

       / [occur S] groupname [genericarg]  ; preempted by above

   A group entry can be built from a named group, or

       / [occur S] &quot;(&quot; S group S &quot;)&quot;

   from a parenthesized group, again with a possible occurrence
   indicator.

   memberkey = type1 S [&quot;^&quot; S] &quot;=&gt;&quot;
             / bareword S &quot;:&quot;
             / value S &quot;:&quot;

   Key types can be given by a type expression, a bareword (which stands
   for a type that just contains a string value created from this
   bareword), or a value (which stands for a type that just contains
   this value).  A key value matches its key type if the key value is a
   member of the key type, unless a cut preceding it in the group
   applies (see <a href="#section-3.5.4">Section 3.5.4</a> for how map matching is influenced by the
   presence of the cuts denoted by &quot;^&quot; or &quot;:&quot; in previous entries).

   bareword = id

   A bareword is an alternative way to write a type with a single text
   string value; it can only be used in the syntactic context given
   above.

   optcom = S [&quot;,&quot; S]

   (Optional commas do not influence the matching.)

   occur = [uint] &quot;*&quot; [uint]
         / &quot;+&quot;
         / &quot;?&quot;

   An occurrence indicator modifies the group given to its right by
   requiring the group to match the sequence to be matched exactly for a
   certain number of times (see <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>) in sequence, i.e., it acts
   as a (possibly infinite) group choice that contains choices with the
   group repeated each of the occurrences times.

   be familiar to readers from programming languages, with the possible
   exception of h&#x27;..&#x27; and b64&#x27;..&#x27; for byte strings, as well as syntactic

   This appendix is normative.

   The following prelude is automatically added to each CDDL file.
   (Note that technically, it is a postlude, as it does not disturb the
   selection of the first rule as the root of the definition.)

                  any = #

                  uint = #0
                  nint = #1
                  int = uint / nint

                  bstr = #2
                  bytes = bstr
                  tstr = #3

                  integer = int / bigint
                  unsigned = uint / biguint
                  decfrac = #6.4([e10: int, m: integer])

                          Figure 14: CDDL Prelude

   Note that the prelude is deemed to be fixed.  This means, for
   instance, that additional tags beyond those defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>], as
   registered, need to be defined in each CDDL file that is using them.

   A common stumbling point is that the prelude does not define a type
   &quot;string&quot;.  CBOR has byte strings (&quot;bytes&quot; in the prelude) and text
   strings (&quot;text&quot;), so a type that is simply called &quot;string&quot; would be
   ambiguous.

   This appendix is normative.

   The JSON generic data model (implicit in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>]) is a subset of
   the generic data model of CBOR.  So, one can use CDDL with JSON by
   limiting oneself to what can be represented in JSON.  Roughly
   speaking, this means leaving out byte strings, tags, and simple
   values other than &quot;false&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, and &quot;null&quot;, leading to the
   following limited prelude:

             Figure 15: JSON-Compatible Subset of CDDL Prelude

   (The major types given here do not have a direct meaning in JSON, but
   they can be interpreted as CBOR major types translated through
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049#section-4">Section&nbsp;4 of [RFC7049]</a>.)

   There are a few fine points in using CDDL with JSON.  First, JSON
   does not distinguish between integers and floating-point numbers;
   there is only one kind of number (which may happen to be integral).
   In this context, specifying a type as &quot;uint&quot;, &quot;nint&quot;, or &quot;int&quot; then
   becomes a predicate that the number be integral.  As an example, this
   means that the following JSON numbers are all matching &quot;uint&quot;:

      10 10.0 1e1 1.0e1 100e-1

   (The fact that these are all integers may be surprising to users
   accustomed to the long tradition in programming languages of using
   decimal points or exponents in a number to indicate a floating-point
   literal.)

   CDDL distinguishes the various CBOR number types, but there is only
   one number type in JSON.  The effect of specifying a floating-point
   precision (float16/float32/float64) is only to restrict the set of




<span class="grey">Birkholz, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 54]</span></pre>

   permissible values to those expressible with binary16/binary32/
   binary64; this is unlikely to be very useful when using CDDL for
   specifying JSON data structures.

   Fundamentally, the number system of JSON itself is based on decimal
   numbers and decimal fractions and does not have limits to its
   precision or range.  In practice, JSON numbers are often parsed into
   a number type that is called &quot;float64&quot; here, creating a number of
   limitations to the generic data model [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7493" title="&quot;The I-JSON Message Format&quot;">RFC7493</a>].  In particular, this
   means that integers can only be expressed with interoperable
   exactness when they lie in the range [-(2**53)+1, (2**53)-1] -- a
   smaller range than that covered by CDDL &quot;int&quot;.

   JSON applications that want to stay compatible with I-JSON (&quot;Internet
   JSON&quot;; see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7493" title="&quot;The I-JSON Message Format&quot;">RFC7493</a>]) may therefore want to define integer types with
   more limited ranges, such as in Figure 16.  Note that the types given
   here are not part of the prelude; they need to be copied into the
   CDDL specification if needed.

               ij-uint = 0..9007199254740991
               ij-nint = -9007199254740991..-1
               ij-int = -9007199254740991..9007199254740991

          Figure 16: I-JSON Types for CDDL (Not Part of Prelude)

   JSON applications that do not need to stay compatible with I-JSON and
   that actually may need to go beyond the 64-bit unsigned and negative
   integers supported by &quot;int&quot; (= &quot;uint&quot;/&quot;nint&quot;) may want to use the
   following additional types from the standard prelude, which are
   expressed in terms of tags but can straightforwardly be mapped into
   JSON (but not I-JSON) numbers:

      biguint = #6.2(bstr)
      bignint = #6.3(bstr)
      bigint = biguint / bignint
      integer = int / bigint
      unsigned = uint / biguint

   CDDL at this point does not have a way to express the unlimited
   floating-point precision that is theoretically possible with JSON; at
   the time of writing, this is rarely used in protocols in practice.

   Note that a data model described in CDDL is always restricted by what
   can be expressed in the serialization; e.g., floating-point values
   such as NaN (not a number) and the infinities cannot be represented
   in JSON even if they are allowed in the CDDL generic data model.

   This appendix is for information only.

   A rough CDDL tool is available.  For CDDL specifications, it can
   check the syntax, generate one or more instances (expressed in CBOR
   diagnostic notation or in pretty-printed JSON), and validate an
   existing instance against the specification:

                   Usage:

   notation, JSON, and YAML [<a href="#ref-YAML" title="&quot;YAML Ain&#x27;t Markup Language (YAML[TM]) Version 1.2&quot;">YAML</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-G" href="#appendix-G">Appendix G</a>.  Extended Diagnostic Notation</span>

   This appendix is normative.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049#section-6">Section&nbsp;6 of [RFC7049]</a> defines a &quot;diagnostic notation&quot; in order to be
   able to converse about CBOR data items without having to resort to
   binary data.  Diagnostic notation is based on JSON, with extensions
   for representing CBOR constructs such as binary data and tags.

   (Standardizing this together with the actual interchange format does
   not serve to create another interchange format but enables the use of
   a shared diagnostic notation in tools for and documents about CBOR.)

   This appendix discusses a few extensions to the diagnostic notation
   that have turned out to be useful since <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049">RFC 7049</a> was written.  We
   refer to the result as Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-G.1" href="#appendix-G.1">G.1</a>.  Whitespace in Byte String Notation</span>

   Examples often benefit from some whitespace (spaces, line breaks) in
   byte strings.  In EDN, whitespace is ignored in prefixed byte
   strings; for instance, the following are equivalent:

      h&#x27;48656c6c6f20776f726c64&#x27;
      h&#x27;48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64&#x27;
      h&#x27;4 86 56c 6c6f
        20776 f726c64&#x27;

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-G.2" href="#appendix-G.2">G.2</a>.  Text in Byte String Notation</span>

   Diagnostic notation notates byte strings in one of the base encodings
   per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4648" title="&quot;The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings&quot;">RFC4648</a>], enclosed in single quotes, prefixed by &gt;h&lt; for base16,
   &gt;b32&lt; for base32, &gt;h32&lt; for base32hex, or &gt;b64&lt; for base64 or
   base64url.  Quite often, byte strings carry bytes that are
   meaningfully interpreted as UTF-8 text.  EDN allows the use of single
   quotes without a prefix to express byte strings with UTF-8 text; for
   instance, the following are equivalent:

      &#x27;hello world&#x27;
      h&#x27;68656c6c6f20776f726c64&#x27;

   The escaping rules of JSON strings are applied equivalently for
   text-based byte strings, e.g., &quot;\&quot; stands for a single backslash and
   &quot;&#x27;&quot; stands for a single quote.  Whitespace is included literally,
   i.e., the previous section does not apply to text-based byte strings.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-G.3" href="#appendix-G.3">G.3</a>.  Embedded CBOR and CBOR Sequences in Byte Strings</span>

   Where a byte string is to carry an embedded CBOR-encoded item, or
   more generally a sequence of zero or more such items, the diagnostic
   notation for these zero or more CBOR data items, separated by commas,
   can be enclosed in &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; to notate the byte string resulting from
   encoding the data items and concatenating the result.  For instance,
   each pair of columns in the following are equivalent:

      &lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt;              h&#x27;01&#x27;
      &lt;&lt;1, 2&gt;&gt;           h&#x27;0102&#x27;
      &lt;&lt;&quot;foo&quot;, null&gt;&gt;    h&#x27;63666F6FF6&#x27;
      &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;               h&#x27;&#x27;

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-G.4" href="#appendix-G.4">G.4</a>.  Concatenated Strings</span>

   While the ability to include whitespace enables line-breaking of
   encoded byte strings, a mechanism is needed to be able to include
   text strings as well as byte strings in direct UTF-8 representation
   into line-based documents (such as RFCs and source code).

   We extend the diagnostic notation by allowing multiple text strings
   or multiple byte strings to be notated separated by whitespace; these
   are then concatenated into a single text or byte string,
   respectively.  Text strings and byte strings do not mix within such a
   concatenation, except that byte string notation can be used inside a
   sequence of concatenated text string notation to encode characters
   that may be better represented in an encoded way.  The following four
   values are equivalent:

      &quot;Hello world&quot;
      &quot;Hello &quot; &quot;world&quot;
      &quot;Hello&quot; h&#x27;20&#x27; &quot;world&quot;
      &quot;&quot; h&#x27;48656c6c6f20776f726c64&#x27; &quot;&quot;

   Similarly, the following byte string values are equivalent:

      &#x27;Hello world&#x27;
      &#x27;Hello &#x27; &#x27;world&#x27;
      &#x27;Hello &#x27; h&#x27;776f726c64&#x27;
      &#x27;Hello&#x27; h&#x27;20&#x27; &#x27;world&#x27;
      &#x27;&#x27; h&#x27;48656c6c6f20776f726c64&#x27; &#x27;&#x27; b64&#x27;&#x27;
      h&#x27;4 86 56c 6c6f&#x27; h&#x27; 20776 f726c64&#x27;

   (Note that the approach of separating by whitespace, while familiar
   from the C language, requires some attention -- a single comma makes
   a big difference here.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-G.5" href="#appendix-G.5">G.5</a>.  Hexadecimal, Octal, and Binary Numbers</span>

   In addition to JSON&#x27;s decimal numbers, EDN provides hexadecimal,
   octal, and binary numbers in the usual C-language notation (octal
   with 0o prefix present only).

   The following are equivalent:

      4711
      0x1267
      0o11147
      0b1001001100111

   As are:

      1.5
      0x1.8p0
      0x18p-4

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-G.6" href="#appendix-G.6">G.6</a>.  Comments</span>

   Longer pieces of diagnostic notation may benefit from comments.  JSON
   famously does not provide for comments, and basic diagnostic notation
   per <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049">RFC 7049</a> inherits this property.

   In EDN, comments can be included, delimited by slashes (&quot;/&quot;).  Any
   text within and including a pair of slashes is considered a comment.

   Comments are considered whitespace.  Hence, they are allowed in
   prefixed byte strings; for instance, the following are equivalent:

      h&#x27;68656c6c6f20776f726c64&#x27;
      h&#x27;68 65 6c /doubled l!/ 6c 6f /hello/
        20 /space/
        77 6f 72 6c 64&#x27; /world/

   This can be used to annotate a CBOR structure as in:

      /grasp-message/ [/M_DISCOVERY/ 1, /session-id/ 10584416,
                       /objective/ [/objective-name/ &quot;opsonize&quot;,
                                    /D, N, S/ 7, /loop-count/ 105]]

   (There are currently no end-of-line comments.  If we want to add
   them, &quot;//&quot; sounds like a reasonable delimiter given that we already
   use slashes for comments, but we could also go, for example,
   for &quot;#&quot;.)

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-H" href="#appendix-H">Appendix H</a>.  Examples</span>

   This appendix is for information only.

   This appendix contains a few examples of structures defined
   using CDDL.  The theme for the examples is taken from [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7071" title="&quot;A Media Type for Reputation Interchange&quot;">RFC7071</a>],
   which defines certain JSON structures in English.  For a similar
   example, it may also be of interest to examine <a href="/doc/html/rfc8007#appendix-A">Appendix&nbsp;A of
   [RFC8007]</a>, which contains a CDDL definition for a JSON structure
   defined in the main body of that RFC.

   These examples all happen to describe data that is interchanged in
   JSON.  Examples for CDDL definitions of data that is interchanged in
   CBOR can be found in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8152" title="&quot;CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)&quot;">RFC8152</a>], [<a href="#ref-GRASP" title="&quot;A Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP)&quot;">GRASP</a>], and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428" title="&quot;Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)&quot;">RFC8428</a>].

   [<a id="ref-RFC7071">RFC7071</a>] defines the &quot;reputon&quot; structure for JSON using somewhat
   formalized English text.  Here is a (somewhat verbose) equivalent
   definition using the same terms, but notated in CDDL:

                 reputation-object = {
                   reputation-context,
                   reputon-list
                 }

                 reputation-context = (
                   application: text
                 )

                 reputon-list = (
                   reputons: reputon-array
                 )

                 reputon-array = [* reputon]

                 reputon = {
                   rater-value,
                   assertion-value,
                   rated-value,
                   rating-value,
                   ? conf-value,
                   ? normal-value,
                   ? sample-value,
                   ? gen-value,
                   ? expire-value,
                   * ext-value,
                 }

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc8610">RFC 8610</a>                          CDDL                         June 2019</span>


                 rater-value = ( rater: text )
                 assertion-value = ( assertion: text )
                 rated-value = ( rated: text )
                 rating-value = ( rating: float16 )
                 conf-value = ( confidence: float16 )
                 normal-value = ( normal-rating: float16 )
                 sample-value = ( sample-size: uint )
                 gen-value = ( generated: uint )
                 expire-value = ( expires: uint )
                 ext-value = ( text =&gt; any )

   An equivalent, more compact form of this example would be:

                        reputation-object = {
                          application: text
                          reputons: [* reputon]
                        }

                        reputon = {
                          rater: text
                          assertion: text
                          rated: text
                          rating: float16
                          ? confidence: float16
                          ? normal-rating: float16
                          ? sample-size: uint
                          ? generated: uint
                          ? expires: uint
                          * text =&gt; any
                        }

   Note how this rather clearly delineates the structure somewhat
   shrouded by so many words in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7071#section-6.2.2">Section&nbsp;6.2.2 of [RFC7071]</a>.  Also, this
   definition makes it clear that several ext-values are allowed (by
   definition with different member names); <a href="/doc/html/rfc7071">RFC 7071</a> could be read to
   forbid the repetition of ext-value (&quot;A specific reputon-element
   MUST NOT appear more than once&quot; is ambiguous).

Acknowledgements

   Inspiration was taken from the C and Pascal languages, MPEG&#x27;s
   conventions for describing structures in the ISO base media file
   format, RELAX NG and its compact syntax [<a href="#ref-RELAXNG" title="&quot;Information technology -- Document Schema Definition Language (DSDL) -- Part 2: Regular-grammar- based validation -- RELAX NG&quot;">RELAXNG</a>], and, in
   particular, Andrew Lee Newton&#x27;s early proposals on JSON Content Rules
   (JCR) as found in draft version four (-04) of [<a href="#ref-JCR" title="&quot;A Language for Rules Describing JSON Content&quot;">JCR</a>].

   Lots of highly useful feedback came from members of the IETF CBOR WG
   -- in particular, Ari Keranen, Brian Carpenter, Burt Harris, Jeffrey
   Yasskin, Jim Hague, Jim Schaad, Joe Hildebrand, Max Pritikin, Michael
   Richardson, Pete Cordell, Sean Leonard, and Yaron Sheffer.  Also,
   Francesca Palombini and Joe volunteered to chair the WG when it was
   created, providing the framework for generating and processing this
   feedback, with Barry Leiba having taken over from Joe since then.
   Chris Lonvick and Ines Robles provided additional reviews during IESG
   processing, and Alexey Melnikov steered the process as the
   responsible Area Director.

   The CDDL tool described in <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a> was written by Carsten Bormann,
   building on previous work by Troy Heninger and Tom Lord.

   CDDL was originally conceived by Bert Greevenbosch, who also wrote
   the original five draft versions of this document.
