Abstract

   This document contains a &quot;roadmap&quot; to the Requests for Comments (RFC)
   documents relating to the Internet&#x27;s Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP).  This roadmap provides a brief summary of the documents
   defining TCP and various TCP extensions that have accumulated in the
   RFC series.  This serves as a guide and quick reference for both TCP
   implementers and other parties who desire information contained in
   the TCP-related RFCs.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   A correct and efficient implementation of the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP) is a critical part of the software of most Internet
   hosts.  As TCP has evolved over the years, many distinct documents
   have become part of the accepted standard for TCP.  At the same time,
   a large number of more experimental modifications to TCP have also
   been published in the RFC series, along with informational notes,
   case studies, and other advice.

   As an introduction to newcomers and an attempt to organize the
   plethora of information for old hands, this document contains a
   &quot;roadmap&quot; to the TCP-related RFCs.  It provides a brief summary of
   the RFC documents that define TCP.  This should provide guidance to
   implementers on the relevance and significance of the standards-track
   extensions, informational notes, and best current practices that
   relate to TCP.






<span class="grey">Duke, et al.                 Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc4614">RFC 4614</a>                      TCP Roadmap                 September 2006</span>


   This document is not an update of <a href="/doc/html/rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> and is not a rigorous
   standard for what needs to be implemented in TCP.  This document is
   merely an informational roadmap that captures, organizes, and
   summarizes most of the RFC documents that a TCP implementer,
   experimenter, or student should be aware of.  Particular comments or
   broad categorizations that this document makes about individual
   mechanisms and behaviors are not to be taken as definitive, nor
   should the content of this document alone influence implementation
   decisions.

   This roadmap includes a brief description of the contents of each
   TCP-related RFC.  In some cases, we simply supply the abstract or a
   key summary sentence from the text as a terse description.  In
   addition, a letter code after an RFC number indicates its category in
   the RFC series (see <a href="/doc/html/bcp9">BCP 9</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2026">RFC2026</a>] for explanation of these
   categories):

      S - Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or
          Standard)

      E - Experimental

      B - Best Current Practice

      I - Informational

   Note that the category of an RFC does not necessarily reflect its
   current relevance.  For instance, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC 2581</a> is nearly universally
   deployed although it is only a Proposed Standard.  Similarly, some
   Informational RFCs contain significant technical proposals for
   changing TCP.

   This roadmap is divided into four main sections.  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> lists the
   RFCs that describe absolutely required TCP behaviors for proper
   functioning and interoperability.  Further RFCs that describe
   strongly encouraged, but non-essential, behaviors are listed in
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  Experimental extensions that are not yet standard
   practices, but that potentially could be in the future, are described
   in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   The reader will probably notice that these three sections are broadly
   equivalent to MUST/SHOULD/MAY specifications (per <a href="/doc/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>), and
   although the authors support this intuition, this document is merely
   descriptive; it does not represent a binding standards-track
   position.  Individual implementers still need to examine the
   standards documents themselves to evaluate specific requirement
   levels.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc4614">RFC 4614</a>                      TCP Roadmap                 September 2006</span>


   A small number of older experimental extensions that have not been
   widely implemented, deployed, and used are noted in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  Many
   other supporting documents that are relevant to the development,
   implementation, and deployment of TCP are described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.
   Within each section, RFCs are listed in the chronological order of
   their publication dates.

   A small number of fairly ubiquitous important implementation
   practices that are not currently documented in the RFC series are
   listed in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Basic Functionality</span>

   A small number of documents compose the core specification of TCP.
   These define the required basic functionalities of TCP&#x27;s header
   parsing, state machine, congestion control, and retransmission
   timeout computation.  These base specifications must be correctly
   followed for interoperability.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a> S: &quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot;, STD 7 (September 1981)

      This is the fundamental TCP specification document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc0793">RFC0793</a>].
      Written by Jon Postel as part of the Internet protocol suite&#x27;s
      core, it describes the TCP packet format, the TCP state machine
      and event processing, and TCP&#x27;s semantics for data transmission,
      reliability, flow control, multiplexing, and acknowledgment.

      <a href="/doc/html/rfc793#section-3.6">Section&nbsp;3.6 of RFC 793</a>, describing TCP&#x27;s handling of the IP
      precedence and security compartment, is mostly irrelevant today.
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc2873">RFC 2873</a> changed the IP precedence handling, and the security
      compartment portion of the API is no longer implemented or used.
      In addition, <a href="/doc/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a> did not describe any congestion control
      mechanism.  Otherwise, however, the majority of this document
      still accurately describes modern TCPs.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a> is the last of a
      series of developmental TCP specifications, starting in the
      Internet Experimental Notes (IENs) and continuing in the RFC
      series.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> S: &quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers&quot;
   (October 1989)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1122">RFC1122</a>] updates and clarifies <a href="/doc/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a>, fixing some
      specification bugs and oversights.  It also explains some features
      such as keep-alives and Karn&#x27;s and Jacobson&#x27;s RTO estimation
      algorithms [<a href="#ref-KP87">KP87</a>][Jac88][<a href="#ref-JK92">JK92</a>].  ICMP interactions are mentioned,
      and some tips are given for efficient implementation.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> is
      an Applicability Statement, listing the various features that

      standards-conforming TCP implementations.  Unlike a purely
      informational &quot;roadmap&quot;, this Applicability Statement is a
      standards document and gives formal rules for implementation.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2460">RFC 2460</a> S: &quot;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification
   (December 1998)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2460">RFC2460</a>] is of relevance to TCP because it defines
      how the pseudo-header for TCP&#x27;s checksum computation is derived
      when 128-bit IPv6 addresses are used instead of 32-bit IPv4
      addresses.  Additionally, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2675">RFC 2675</a> describes TCP changes required
      to support IPv6 jumbograms.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC 2581</a> S: &quot;TCP Congestion Control&quot; (April 1999)

      Although <a href="/doc/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a> did not contain any congestion control
      mechanisms, today congestion control is a required component of
      TCP implementations.  This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC2581</a>] defines the current
      versions of Van Jacobson&#x27;s congestion avoidance and control
      mechanisms for TCP, based on his 1988 SIGCOMM paper [<a href="#ref-Jac88">Jac88</a>].  <a href="/doc/html/rfc2001">RFC</a>
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc2001">2001</a> was a conceptual precursor that was obsoleted by <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC 2581</a>.

      A number of behaviors that together constitute what the community
      refers to as &quot;Reno TCP&quot; are described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC 2581</a>.  The name
      &quot;Reno&quot; comes from the Net/2 release of the 4.3 BSD operating
      system.  This is generally regarded as the least common
      denominator among TCP flavors currently found running on Internet
      hosts.  Reno TCP includes the congestion control features of slow
      start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.

      <a href="/doc/html/rfc1122">RFC 1122</a> mandates the implementation of a congestion control
      mechanism, and <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC 2581</a> details the currently accepted mechanism.
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC 2581</a> differs slightly from the other documents listed in this
      section, as it does not affect the ability of two TCP endpoints to
      communicate; however, congestion control remains a critical
      component of any widely deployed TCP implementation and is
      required for the avoidance of congestion collapse and to ensure
      fairness among competing flows.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2873">RFC 2873</a> S: &quot;TCP Processing of the IPv4 Precedence Field&quot; (June 2000)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2873">RFC2873</a>] removes from the TCP specification all
      processing of the precedence bits of the TOS byte of the IP
      header.  This resolves a conflict over the use of these bits
      between <a href="/doc/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a> and Differentiated Services [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2474">RFC2474</a>].

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2988">RFC 2988</a> S: &quot;Computing TCP&#x27;s Retransmission Timer&quot; (November 2000)

      Abstract: &quot;This document defines the standard algorithm that
      Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) senders are required to use to
      compute and manage their retransmission timer.  It expands on the
      discussion in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1122#section-4.2.3.1">section&nbsp;4.2.3.1 of RFC 1122</a> and upgrades the
      requirement of supporting the algorithm from a SHOULD to a MUST.&quot;

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Recommended Enhancements</span>

   This section describes recommended TCP modifications that improve
   performance and security.  RFCs 1323 and 3168 represent fundamental
   changes to the protocol.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc1323">RFC 1323</a>, based on RFCs 1072 and 1185,
   allows better utilization of high bandwidth-delay product paths by
   providing some needed mechanisms for high-rate transfers.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc3168">RFC 3168</a>
   describes a change to the Internet&#x27;s architecture, whereby routers
   signal end-hosts of growing congestion levels and can do so before
   packet losses are forced.  <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> lists improvements in the
   congestion control and loss recovery mechanisms specified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">2581</a>.  <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> describes further refinements that make use of
   selective acknowledgments.  <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> deals with the problem of
   preventing forged segments.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1323">RFC 1323</a> S:  &quot;TCP Extensions for High Performance&quot; (May 1992)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1323">RFC1323</a>] defines TCP extensions for window scaling,
      timestamps, and protection against wrapped sequence numbers, for
      efficient and safe operation over paths with large bandwidth-delay
      products.  These extensions are commonly found in currently used
      systems; however, they may require manual tuning and
      configuration.  One issue in this specification that is still
      under discussion concerns a modification to the algorithm for
      estimating the mean RTT when timestamps are used.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2675">RFC 2675</a> S: &quot;IPv6 Jumbograms&quot; (August 1999)

      IPv6 supports longer datagrams than were allowed in IPv4.  These
      are known as Jumbograms, and use with TCP has necessitated changes
      to the handling of TCP&#x27;s MSS and Urgent fields (both 16 bits).
      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2675">RFC2675</a>] explains those changes.  Although it
      describes changes to basic header semantics, these changes should
      only affect the use of very large segments, such as IPv6
      jumbograms, which are currently rarely used in the general
      Internet.  Supporting the behavior described in this document does
      not affect interoperability with other TCP implementations when
      IPv4 or non-jumbogram IPv6 is used.  This document states that
      jumbograms are to only be used when it can be guaranteed that all

      receiving nodes, including each router in the end-to-end path,
      will support jumbograms.  If even a single node that does not
      support jumbograms is attached to a local network, then no host on
      that network may use jumbograms.  This explains why jumbogram use
      has been rare, and why this document is considered a performance
      optimization and not part of TCP over IPv6&#x27;s basic functionality.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc3168">RFC 3168</a> S: &quot;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   to IP&quot; (September 2001)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3168">RFC3168</a>] defines a means for end hosts to detect
      congestion before congested routers are forced to discard packets.
      Although congestion notification takes place at the IP level, ECN
      requires support at the transport level (e.g., in TCP) to echo the
      bits and adapt the sending rate.  This document updates <a href="/doc/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a> to
      define two previously unused flag bits in the TCP header for ECN
      support.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc3540">RFC 3540</a> provides a supplementary (experimental) means
      for more secure use of ECN, and <a href="/doc/html/rfc2884">RFC 2884</a> provides some sample
      results from using ECN.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Congestion Control and Loss Recovery Extensions</span>

   Two of the most important aspects of TCP are its congestion control
   and loss recovery features.  TCP traditionally treats lost packets as
   indicating congestion-related loss, and cannot distinguish between
   congestion-related loss and loss due to transmission errors.  Even
   when ECN is in use, there is a rather intimate coupling between
   congestion control and loss recovery mechanisms.  There are several
   extensions to both features, and more often than not, a particular
   extension applies to both.  In this sub-section, we group
   enhancements to either congestion control, loss recovery, or both,
   which can be performed unilaterally; that is, without negotiating
   support between endpoints.  In the next sub-section, we group the
   extensions that specify or rely on the SACK option, which must be
   negotiated bilaterally.  TCP implementations should include the
   enhancements from both sub-sections so that TCP senders can perform
   well without regard to the feature sets of other hosts they connect
   to.  For example, if SACK use is not successfully negotiated, a host
   should use the NewReno behavior as a fall back.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc3042">RFC 3042</a> S: &quot;Enhancing TCP&#x27;s Loss Recovery Using Limited Transmit&quot;
   (January 2001)

      Abstract: &quot;This document proposes Limited Transmit, a new
      Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) mechanism that can be used to
      more effectively recover lost segments when a connection&#x27;s
      congestion window is small, or when a large number of segments are
      lost in a single transmission window.&quot;  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3042">RFC3042</a>] Tests from 2004
      showed that Limited Transmit was deployed in roughly one third of
      the web servers tested [<a href="#ref-MAF04">MAF04</a>].

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc3390">RFC 3390</a> S: &quot;Increasing TCP&#x27;s Initial Window&quot; (October 2002)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3390">RFC3390</a>] updates <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC 2581</a> to permit an initial TCP
      window of three or four segments during the slow-start phase,
      depending on the segment size.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc3782">RFC 3782</a> S: &quot;The NewReno Modification to TCP&#x27;s Fast Recovery
   Algorithm&quot; (April 2004)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3782">RFC3782</a>] specifies a modification to the standard
      Reno fast recovery algorithm, whereby a TCP sender can use partial
      acknowledgments to make inferences determining the next segment to
      send in situations where SACK would be helpful but isn&#x27;t
      available.  Although it is only a slight modification, the NewReno
      behavior can make a significant difference in performance when
      multiple segments are lost from a single window of data.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  SACK-Based Loss Recovery and Congestion Control</span>

   The base TCP specification in <a href="/doc/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a> provided only a simple
   cumulative acknowledgment mechanism.  However, a selective
   acknowledgment (SACK) mechanism provides performance improvement in
   the presence of multiple packet losses from the same flight, more
   than outweighing the modest increase in complexity.  A TCP should be
   expected to implement SACK; however, SACK is a negotiated option and
   is only used if support is advertised by both sides of a connection.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2018">RFC 2018</a> S: &quot;TCP Selective Acknowledgment Options&quot; (October 1996)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2018">RFC2018</a>] defines the basic selective acknowledgment
      (SACK) mechanism for TCP.

      acknowledging duplicate segments.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc3517">RFC 3517</a> S: &quot;A Conservative Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)-based
   Loss Recovery Algorithm for TCP&quot; (April 2003)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3517">RFC3517</a>] describes a relatively sophisticated
      algorithm that a TCP sender can use for loss recovery when SACK
      reports more than one segment lost from a single flight of data.
      Although support for the exchange of SACK information is widely
      implemented, not all implementations use an algorithm as
      sophisticated as that described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3517">RFC 3517</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Dealing with Forged Segments</span>

   By default, TCP lacks any cryptographic structures to differentiate
   legitimate segments and those spoofed from malicious hosts.  Spoofing
   valid segments requires correctly guessing a number of fields.  The
   documents in this sub-section describe ways to make that guessing
   harder, or to prevent it from being able to affect a connection
   negatively.

   The TCPM working group is currently in progress towards fully
   understanding and defining mechanisms for preventing spoofing attacks
   (including both spoofed TCP segments and ICMP datagrams).  Some of
   the solutions being considered rely on TCP modifications, whereas
   others rely on security at lower layers (like IPsec) for protection.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1948">RFC 1948</a> I: &quot;Defending Against Sequence Number Attacks&quot; (May 1996)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1948">RFC1948</a>] describes the TCP vulnerability that
      allows an attacker to send forged TCP packets, by guessing the
      initial sequence number in the three-way handshake.  Simple
      defenses against exploitation are then described.  Some variation
      is implemented in most currently used operating systems.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2385">RFC 2385</a> S: &quot;Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature
   Option&quot; (August 1998)

      From document: &quot;This document describes current existing practice
      for securing BGP against certain simple attacks.  It is understood
      to have security weaknesses against concerted attacks.

      This memo describes a TCP extension to enhance security for BGP.
      It defines a new TCP option for carrying an MD5 digest in a TCP
      segment.  This digest acts like a signature for that segment,
      incorporating information known only to the connection end points.
      Since BGP uses TCP as its transport, using this option in the way
      described in this paper significantly reduces the danger from
      certain security attacks on BGP.&quot;  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2385">RFC2385</a>]

      TCP MD5 options are currently only used in very limited contexts,
      primarily for defending BGP exchanges between routers.  Some
      deployment notes for those using TCP MD5 are found in the later

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Experimental Extensions</span>

   The RFCs in this section are still experimental, but they may become
   proposed standards in the future.  At least part of the reason that
   they are still experimental is to gain more wide-scale experience
   with them before a standards track decision is made.  By their
   publication as experimental RFCs, it is hoped that the community of
   TCP researchers will analyze and test the contents of these RFCs.
   Although experimentation is encouraged, there is not yet formal
   consensus that these are fully logical and safe behaviors.  Wide-
   scale deployment of implementations that use these features should be
   well thought-out in terms of consequences.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2140">RFC 2140</a> I: &quot;TCP Control Block Interdependence&quot; (April 1997)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2140">RFC2140</a>] suggests how TCP connections between the
      same endpoints might share information, such as their congestion
      control state.  To some degree, this is done in practice by a few
      operating systems; for example, Linux currently has a destination
      cache.  Although this RFC is technically informational, the
      concepts it describes are in experimental use, so we include it in
      this section.

      A related proposal, the Congestion Manager, is specified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3124">RFC</a>
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc3124">3124</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3124">RFC3124</a>].  The idea behind the Congestion Manager, moving
      congestion control outside of individual TCP connections,
      represents a modification to the core of TCP, which supports
      sharing information among TCP connections as well.  Although a
      Proposed Standard, some pieces of the Congestion Manager support
      architecture have not been specified yet, and it has not achieved
      use or implementation beyond experimental stacks, so it is not
      listed among the standard TCP enhancements in this roadmap.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2861">RFC 2861</a> E: &quot;TCP Congestion Window Validation&quot; (June 2000)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2861">RFC2861</a>] suggests reducing the congestion window
      over time when no packets are flowing.  This behavior is more
      aggressive than that specified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2581">RFC 2581</a>, which says that a TCP
      sender SHOULD set its congestion window to the initial window
      after an idle period of an RTO or greater.

      number of bytes acknowledged instead of the number of
      acknowledgments received.  This has been implemented in Linux.
      The ABC mechanism behaves differently from the standard method
      when there is not a one-to-one relationship between data segments
      and acknowledgments.  ABC still operates within the accepted
      guidelines, but is more robust to delayed ACKs and ACK-division

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4015">RFC4015</a>] describes the response portion of the
      Eifel algorithm, which can be used in conjunction with one of
      several methods of detecting when loss recovery has been
      spuriously entered, such as the Eifel detection algorithm in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3522">RFC</a>
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc3522">3522</a>, the algorithm in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3708">RFC 3708</a>, or F-RTO in <a href="/doc/html/rfc4138">RFC 4138</a>.

      Abstract: &quot;Based on an appropriate detection algorithm, the Eifel
      response algorithm provides a way for a TCP sender to respond to a
      detected spurious timeout.  It adapts the retransmission timer to
      avoid further spurious timeouts, and can avoid - depending on the
      detection algorithm - the often unnecessary go-back-N retransmits
      that would otherwise be sent.  In addition, the Eifel response
      algorithm restores the congestion control state in such a way that
      packet bursts are avoided.&quot;

      <a href="/doc/html/rfc4015">RFC 4015</a> is itself a Proposed Standard.  The consensus of the TCPM
      working group was to place it in this section of the roadmap
      document due to three factors.

      1.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc4015">RFC 4015</a> operates on the output of a detection algorithm, for
          which there is currently no available mechanism on the
          standards track.

      2.  The working group was not aware of any wide deployment and use
          of <a href="/doc/html/rfc4015">RFC 4015</a>.

      3.  The consensus of the working group, after a discussion of the
          known Intellectual Property Rights claims on the techniques
          described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc4015">RFC 4015</a>, identified this section of the roadmap
          as an appropriate location.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc4138">RFC 4138</a> E: &quot;Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An Algorithm for Detecting
   Spurious Retransmission Timeouts with TCP and the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol&quot; (August 2005)

      The F-RTO detection algorithm [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4138">RFC4138</a>] provides another option
      for inferring spurious retransmission timeouts.  Unlike some
      similar detection methods, F-RTO does not rely on the use of any
      TCP options.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Historic Extensions</span>

   The RFCs listed here define extensions that have thus far failed to
   arouse substantial interest from implementers, or that were found to
   be defective for general use.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1106">RFC 1106</a> &quot;TCP Big Window and NAK Options&quot; (June 1989): found
   defective

      This RFC [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1106">RFC1106</a>] defined an alternative to the Window Scale
      option for using large windows and described the &quot;negative
      acknowledgement&quot; or NAK option.  There is a comparison of NAK and
      SACK methods, and early discussion of TCP over satellite issues.
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc1110">RFC 1110</a> explains some problems with the approaches described in
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc1106">RFC 1106</a>.  The options described in this document have not been
      adopted by the larger community, although NAKs are used in the
      SCPS-TP adaptation of TCP for satellite and spacecraft use,
      developed by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems
      (CCSDS).

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1110">RFC 1110</a> &quot;A Problem with the TCP Big Window Option&quot; (August 1989):
   deprecates <a href="/doc/html/rfc1106">RFC 1106</a>

      Abstract: &quot;The TCP Big Window option discussed in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1106">RFC 1106</a> will
      not work properly in an Internet environment which has both a high
      bandwidth * delay product and the possibility of disordering and
      duplicating packets.  In such networks, the window size must not
      be increased without a similar increase in the sequence number
      space.  Therefore, a different approach to big windows should be
      taken in the Internet.&quot;  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1110">RFC1110</a>]

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1146">RFC 1146</a> E &quot;TCP Alternate Checksum Options&quot; (March 1990): lack of
   interest

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1146">RFC1146</a>] defined more robust TCP checksums than the
      16-bit ones-complement in use today.  A typographical error in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1145">RFC</a>
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc1145">1145</a> is fixed in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1146">RFC 1146</a>; otherwise, the documents are the same.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1263">RFC 1263</a> &quot;TCP Extensions Considered Harmful&quot; (October 1991) - lack of
   interest

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1263">RFC1263</a>] argues against &quot;backwards compatible&quot; TCP
      extensions.  Specifically mentioned are several TCP enhancements
      that have been successful, including timestamps, window scaling,
      PAWS, and SACK.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc1263">RFC 1263</a> presents an alternative approach called
      &quot;protocol evolution&quot;, whereby several evolutionary versions of TCP
      would exist on hosts.  These distinct TCP versions would represent
      upgrades to each other and could be header-incompatible.

      Interoperability would be provided by having a virtualization
      layer select the right TCP version for a particular connection.
      This idea did not catch on with the community, although the type
      of extensions <a href="/doc/html/rfc1263">RFC 1263</a> specifically targeted as harmful did become
      popular.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1644">RFC 1644</a> E &quot;T/TCP -- TCP Extensions for Transactions Functional
   Specification&quot; (July 1994): found defective

      The inventors of TCP believed that cached connection state could
      have been used to eliminate TCP&#x27;s 3-way handshake, to support
      two-packet request/response exchanges.  RFCs 1379 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1379">RFC1379</a>] and
      1644 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1644">RFC1644</a>] show that this is far from simple.  Furthermore,
      T/TCP floundered on the ease of denial-of-service attacks that can
      result.  One idea pioneered by T/TCP lives on in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2140">RFC 2140</a>, in the
      sharing of state across connections.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1693">RFC 1693</a> E &quot;An Extension to TCP: Partial Order Service&quot; (November
   1994): lack of interest

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1693">RFC1693</a>] defines a TCP extension for applications
      that do not care about the order in which application-layer
      objects are received.  Examples are multimedia and database
      applications.  In practice, these applications either accept the
      possible performance loss because of TCP&#x27;s strict ordering or use
      more specialized transport protocols.

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1071">RFC1071</a>] lists a number of implementation
      techniques for efficiently computing the Internet checksum (used
      by TCP).

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1624">RFC 1624</a> I: &quot;Computation of the Internet Checksum via Incremental
   Update&quot; (May 1994)

      Incrementally updating the Internet checksum is useful to routers
      in updating IP checksums.  Some middleboxes that alter TCP headers
      may also be able to update the TCP checksum incrementally.  This
      document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1624">RFC1624</a>] expands upon the explanation of the incremental
      update procedure in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1071">RFC 1071</a>.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1936">RFC 1936</a> I: &quot;Implementing the Internet Checksum in Hardware&quot; (April

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1936">RFC1936</a>] describes the motivation for implementing
      the Internet checksum in hardware, rather than in software, and
      provides an implementation example.

   The first MIB module defined for use with Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP) (in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1066">RFC 1066</a> and its update, <a href="/doc/html/rfc1156">RFC 1156</a>) was a single
   monolithic MIB module, called MIB-I.  This evolved over time to be
   MIB-II (<a href="/doc/html/rfc1213">RFC 1213</a>).  It then became apparent that having a single
   monolithic MIB module was not scalable, given the number and breadth
   of MIB data definitions that needed to be included.  Thus, additional
   MIB modules were defined, and those parts of MIB-II that needed to
   evolve were split off.  Eventually, the remaining parts of MIB-II
   were also split off, the TCP-specific part being documented in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2012">RFC</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2012">2012</a>.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc4022">RFC 4022</a> should be supported.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> S: &quot;Management Information Base for Network Management of
   TCP/IP-based Internets&quot; (May 1990)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1156">RFC1156</a>] describes the required MIB fields for TCP
      implementations, with minor corrections and no technical changes
      from <a href="/doc/html/rfc1066">RFC 1066</a>, which it obsoletes.  This is the standards track
      document for MIB-I.

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1213">RFC 1213</a> S: &quot;Management Information Base for Network Management of
   TCP/IP-based Internets: MIB-II&quot; (March 1991)

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1213">RFC1213</a>] describes the second version of the MIB in

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2012">RFC2012</a>] defined the TCP MIB, in an update to <a href="/doc/html/rfc1213">RFC</a>
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc1213">1213</a>.  It is now obsoleted by <a href="/doc/html/rfc4022">RFC 4022</a>.

      This document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2452">RFC2452</a>] augments <a href="/doc/html/rfc2012">RFC 2012</a> by adding an IPv6-
      specific connection table.  The rest of 2012 holds for any IP
      version.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc2012">RFC 2012</a> is now obsoleted by <a href="/doc/html/rfc4022">RFC 4022</a>.

      Although it is a standards track document, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2452">RFC 2452</a> is considered
      a historic mistake by the MIB community, as it is based on the
      idea of parallel IPv4 and IPv6 structures.  Although IPv6 requires
      new structures, the community has decided to define a single
      generic structure for both IPv4 and IPv6.  This will aid in
      definition, implementation, and transition between IPv4 and IPv6.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Undocumented TCP Features</span>

   There are a few important implementation tactics for the TCP that
   have not yet been described in any RFC.  Although this roadmap is
   primarily concerned with mapping the TCP RFCs, this section is
   included because an implementer needs to be aware of these important
   issues.

   SYN Cookies

      A mechanism known as &quot;SYN cookies&quot; is widely used to thwart TCP
      SYN flooding attacks, in which an attacker sends a flood of SYNs
      to a victim but fails to complete the 3-way handshake.  The result
      is exhaustion of resources at the server.  The SYN cookie
      mechanism allows the server to return a cleverly chosen initial
      sequence number that has all the required state for the secure
      completion of the handshake.  Then the server can avoid saving
      connection state during the 3-way handshake and thus survive a SYN
      flooding attack.

      A web search for &quot;SYN cookies&quot; will reveal a number of useful
      descriptions of this mechanism, although there is currently no RFC
      on the matter.

   Header Prediction

      Header prediction is a trick to speed up the processing of
      segments.  Van Jacobson and Mike Karels developed the technique in
      the late 1980s.  The basic idea is that some processing time can
      be saved when most of a segment&#x27;s fields can be predicted from
      previous segments.  A good description of this was sent to the
      TCP-IP mailing list by Van Jacobson on March 9, 1988:





<span class="grey">Duke, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 23]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-24" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc4614">RFC 4614</a>                      TCP Roadmap                 September 2006</span>


         Quite a bit of the speedup comes from an algorithm that we
         (&#x27;we&#x27; refers to collaborator Mike Karels and myself) are
         calling &quot;header prediction&quot;.  The idea is that if you&#x27;re in the
         middle of a bulk data transfer and have just seen a packet, you
         know what the next packet is going to look like:  It will look
         just like the current packet with either the sequence number or
         ack number updated (depending on whether you&#x27;re the sender or
         receiver).  Combining this with the &quot;Use hints&quot; epigram from
         Butler Lampson&#x27;s classic &quot;Epigrams for System Designers&quot;, you
         start to think of the tcp state (rcv.nxt, snd.una, etc.) as
         &quot;hints&quot; about what the next packet should look like.

         If you arrange those &quot;hints&quot; so they match the layout of a tcp
         packet header, it takes a single 14-byte compare to see if your
         prediction is correct (3 longword compares to pick up the send
         &amp; ack sequence numbers, header length, flags and window, plus a
         short compare on the length).  If the prediction is correct,
         there&#x27;s a single test on the length to see if you&#x27;re the sender
         or receiver followed by the appropriate processing.  E.g., if
         the length is non-zero (you&#x27;re the receiver), checksum and
         append the data to the socket buffer then wake any process
         that&#x27;s sleeping on the buffer.  Update rcv.nxt by the length of
         this packet (this updates your &quot;prediction&quot; of the next
         packet).  Check if you can handle another packet the same size
         as the current one.  If not, set one of the unused flag bits in
         your header prediction to guarantee that the prediction will
         fail on the next packet and force you to go through full
         protocol processing.  Otherwise, you&#x27;re done with this packet.
         So, the *total* tcp protocol processing, exclusive of
         checksumming, is on the order of 6 compares and an add.
