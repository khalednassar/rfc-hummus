Abstract

   This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT)
   (which is defined by <a href="/doc/html/rfc8392">RFC 8392</a>) that the presenter of the CWT
   possesses a particular proof-of-possession key.  Being able to prove
   possession of a key is also sometimes described as being the holder-
   of-key.  This specification provides equivalent functionality to
   &quot;Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)&quot; (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7800">RFC</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7800">7800</a>) but using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and CWTs
   rather than JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and JSON Web Tokens
   (JWTs).

   This specification describes how a CBOR Web Token (CWT) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8392" title="&quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT)&quot;">RFC8392</a>] can
   declare that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-
   of-possession (PoP) key.  Proof of possession of a key is also
   sometimes described as being the holder-of-key.  This specification
   provides equivalent functionality to &quot;Proof-of-Possession Key
   Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7800" title="&quot;Proof-of- Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)&quot;">RFC7800</a>] but using Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] and CWTs [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8392" title="&quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT)&quot;">RFC8392</a>]
   rather than JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>] and JSON Web
   Tokens (JWTs) [<a href="#ref-JWT" title="&quot;JSON Web Token (JWT)&quot;">JWT</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and

   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses terms defined in the CBOR Web Token (CWT)
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8392" title="&quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT)&quot;">RFC8392</a>], CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8152" title="&quot;CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)&quot;">RFC8152</a>], and
   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] specifications.

   These terms are defined by this specification:

   Issuer
      Party that creates the CWT and binds the claims about the subject
      to the proof-of-possession key.

   Presenter
      Party that proves possession of a private key (for asymmetric key
      cryptography) or secret key (for symmetric key cryptography) to a
      recipient of a CWT.

      In the context of OAuth, this party is also called the OAuth
      Client.

   Recipient
      Party that receives the CWT containing the proof-of-possession key
      information from the presenter.

      In the context of OAuth, this party is also called the OAuth
      Resource Server.

   This specification provides examples in CBOR extended diagnostic
   notation, as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8610#appendix-G">Appendix&nbsp;G of [RFC8610]</a>.  The examples
   include line breaks for readability.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Representations for Proof-of-Possession Keys</span>

   By including a &quot;cnf&quot; (confirmation) claim in a CWT, the issuer of the
   CWT declares that the presenter possesses a particular key and that
   the recipient can cryptographically confirm that the presenter has
   possession of that key.  The value of the &quot;cnf&quot; claim is a CBOR map
   (which is defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049#section-2.1">Section&nbsp;2.1 of [RFC7049]</a>) and the members of
   that map identify the proof-of-possession key.

   The presenter can be identified in one of several ways by the CWT,
   depending upon the application requirements.  For instance, some
   applications may use the CWT &quot;sub&quot; (subject) claim [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8392" title="&quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT)&quot;">RFC8392</a>] to
   identify the presenter.  Other applications may use the &quot;iss&quot;
   (issuer) claim [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8392" title="&quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT)&quot;">RFC8392</a>] to identify the presenter.  In some
   applications, the subject identifier might be relative to the issuer
   identified by the &quot;iss&quot; claim.  The actual mechanism used is
   dependent upon the application.  The case in which the presenter is
   the subject of the CWT is analogous to Security Assertion Markup
   Language (SAML) 2.0 [<a href="#ref-OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os">OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os</a>] SubjectConfirmation
   usage.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Confirmation Claim</span>

   The &quot;cnf&quot; claim in the CWT is used to carry confirmation methods.
   Some of them use proof-of-possession keys, while others do not.  This
   design is analogous to the SAML 2.0 [<a href="#ref-OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os">OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os</a>]
   SubjectConfirmation element in which a number of different subject
   confirmation methods can be included (including proof-of-possession
   key information).

   The set of confirmation members that a CWT must contain to be
   considered valid is context dependent and is outside the scope of
   this specification.  Specific applications of CWTs will require
   implementations to understand and process some confirmation members
   in particular ways.  However, in the absence of such requirements,
   all confirmation members that are not understood by implementations
   MUST be ignored.

   <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a> establishes the IANA &quot;CWT Confirmation Methods&quot; registry
   for CWT &quot;cnf&quot; member values and registers the members defined by this
   specification.  Other specifications can register other members used
   for confirmation, including other members for conveying proof-of-
   possession keys using different key representations.

   The &quot;cnf&quot; claim value MUST represent only a single proof-of-
   possession key.  At most one of the &quot;COSE_Key&quot; and
   &quot;Encrypted_COSE_Key&quot; confirmation values defined in Table 1 may be
   present.  Note that if an application needs to represent multiple
   proof-of-possession keys in the same CWT, one way for it to achieve
   this is to use other claim names (in addition to &quot;cnf&quot;) to hold the
   additional proof-of-possession key information.  These claims could
   use the same syntax and semantics as the &quot;cnf&quot; claim.  Those claims
   would be defined by applications or other specifications and could be
   registered in the IANA &quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims&quot; registry
   [<a href="#ref-IANA.CWT.Claims">IANA.CWT.Claims</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Representation of an Asymmetric Proof-of-Possession Key</span>

   When the key held by the presenter is an asymmetric private key, the
   &quot;COSE_Key&quot; member is a COSE_Key [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8152" title="&quot;CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)&quot;">RFC8152</a>] representing the
   corresponding asymmetric public key.  The following example
   demonstrates such a declaration in the CWT Claims Set of a CWT:

    {
    /iss/ 1 : &quot;coaps://server.example.com&quot;,
    /aud/ 3 : &quot;coaps://client.example.org&quot;,
    /exp/ 4 : 1879067471,
    /cnf/ 8 :{
      /COSE_Key/ 1 :{
        /kty/ 1 : /EC2/ 2,
        /crv/ -1 : /P-256/ 1,
        /x/ -2 : h&#x27;d7cc072de2205bdc1537a543d53c60a6acb62eccd890c7fa27c9
                   e354089bbe13&#x27;,
        /y/ -3 : h&#x27;f95e1d4b851a2cc80fff87d8e23f22afb725d535e515d020731e
                   79a3b4e47120&#x27;
       }
     }
   }

   The COSE_Key MUST contain the required key members for a COSE_Key of
   that key type and MAY contain other COSE_Key members, including the
   &quot;kid&quot; (Key ID) member.

   The &quot;COSE_Key&quot; member MAY also be used for a COSE_Key representing a
   symmetric key, provided that the CWT is encrypted so that the key is
   not revealed to unintended parties.  The means of encrypting a CWT is
   explained in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8392" title="&quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT)&quot;">RFC8392</a>].  If the CWT is not encrypted, the symmetric
   key MUST be encrypted as described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  This procedure is
   equivalent to the one defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7800#section-3.3">Section&nbsp;3.3 of [RFC7800]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Representation of an Encrypted Symmetric Proof-of-Possession Key</span>

   When the key held by the presenter is a symmetric key, the
   &quot;Encrypted_COSE_Key&quot; member is an encrypted COSE_Key [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8152" title="&quot;CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)&quot;">RFC8152</a>]
   representing the symmetric key encrypted to a key known to the
   recipient using COSE_Encrypt or COSE_Encrypt0.

   The following example illustrates a symmetric key that could
   subsequently be encrypted for use in the &quot;Encrypted_COSE_Key&quot; member:

   {
    /kty/ 1 : /Symmetric/ 4,
    /alg/ 3 : /HMAC 256-256/ 5,
    /k/ -1 : h&#x27;6684523ab17337f173500e5728c628547cb37df
               e68449c65f885d1b73b49eae1&#x27;
   }

   The COSE_Key representation is used as the plaintext when encrypting
   the key.

   The following example CWT Claims Set of a CWT illustrates the use of
   an encrypted symmetric key as the &quot;Encrypted_COSE_Key&quot; member value:

   {
    /iss/ 1 : &quot;coaps://server.example.com&quot;,
    /sub/ 2 : &quot;24400320&quot;,
    /aud/ 3: &quot;s6BhdRkqt3&quot;,
    /exp/ 4 : 1311281970,
    /iat/ 5 : 1311280970,
    /cnf/ 8 : {
    /Encrypted_COSE_Key/ 2 : [
       /protected header/ h&#x27;A1010A&#x27; /{ \alg\ 1:10 \AES-CCM-16-64-128\}/,
       /unprotected header/ { / iv / 5: h&#x27;636898994FF0EC7BFCF6D3F95B&#x27;},
       /ciphertext/  h&#x27;0573318A3573EB983E55A7C2F06CADD0796C9E584F1D0E3E
                       A8C5B052592A8B2694BE9654F0431F38D5BBC8049FA7F13F&#x27;
      ]
     }
   }

   The example above was generated with the key:

   h&#x27;6162630405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f10&#x27;

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Representation of a Key ID for a Proof-of-Possession Key</span>

   The proof-of-possession key can also be identified using a Key ID
   instead of communicating the actual key, provided the recipient is
   able to obtain the identified key using the Key ID.  In this case,
   the issuer of a CWT declares that the presenter possesses a
   particular key and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm
   the presenter&#x27;s proof of possession of the key by including a &quot;cnf&quot;
   claim in the CWT whose value is a CBOR map containing a &quot;kid&quot; member
   identifying the key.

   The following example demonstrates such a declaration in the CWT
   Claims Set of a CWT:

   {
    /iss/ 1 : &quot;coaps://as.example.com&quot;,
    /aud/ 3 : &quot;coaps://resource.example.org&quot;,
    /exp/ 4 : 1361398824,
    /cnf/ 8 : {
      /kid/ 3 : h&#x27;dfd1aa976d8d4575a0fe34b96de2bfad&#x27;
     }
   }

   The content of the &quot;kid&quot; value is application specific.  For
   instance, some applications may choose to use a cryptographic hash of
   the public key value as the &quot;kid&quot; value.

   Note that the use of a Key ID to identify a proof-of-possession key
   needs to be carefully circumscribed, as described below and in
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.  In cases where the Key ID is not a cryptographic value
   derived from the key or where not all of the parties involved are
   validating the cryptographic derivation, implementers should expect
   collisions where different keys are assigned the same Key ID.
   Recipients of a CWT with a PoP key linked through only a Key ID
   should be prepared to handle such situations.

   In the world of constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there
   is frequently a restriction on the size of Key IDs, either because of
   table constraints or a desire to keep message sizes small.

   Note that the value of a Key ID for a specific key is not necessarily
   the same for different parties.  When sending a COSE encrypted
   message with a shared key, the Key ID may be different on both sides
   of the conversation, with the appropriate one being included in the
   message based on the recipient of the message.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Specifics Intentionally Not Specified</span>

   Proof of possession is often demonstrated by having the presenter
   sign a value determined by the recipient using the key possessed by
   the presenter.  This value is sometimes called a &quot;nonce&quot; or a
   &quot;challenge&quot;.  There are, however, also other means to demonstrate
   freshness of the exchange and to link the proof-of-possession key to
   the participating parties, as demonstrated by various authentication
   and key exchange protocols.

   The means of communicating the nonce and the nature of its contents
   are intentionally not described in this specification, as different
   protocols will communicate this information in different ways.
   Likewise, the means of communicating the signed nonce is also not
   specified, as this is also protocol specific.

   Note that other means of proving possession of the key exist, which
   could be used in conjunction with a CWT&#x27;s confirmation key.
   Applications making use of such alternate means are encouraged to
   register them in the IANA &quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT) Confirmation Methods&quot;
   registry established in <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   All the security considerations that are discussed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8392" title="&quot;CBOR Web Token (CWT)&quot;">RFC8392</a>] also
   apply here.  In addition, proof of possession introduces its own
   unique security issues.  Possessing a key is only valuable if it is
   kept secret.  Appropriate means must be used to ensure that
   unintended parties do not learn private key or symmetric key values.

   Applications utilizing proof of possession SHOULD also utilize
   audience restriction, as described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8392#section-3.1.3">Section&nbsp;3.1.3 of [RFC8392]</a>,
   because it provides additional protections.  Audience restriction can
   be used by recipients to reject messages intended for different
   recipients.  (Of course, applications not using proof of possession
   can also benefit from using audience restriction to reject messages
   intended for different recipients.)

   CBOR Web Tokens with proof-of-possession keys are used in context of
   an architecture, such as the ACE OAuth Framework [<a href="#ref-ACE-OAUTH">ACE-OAUTH</a>], in
   which protocols are used by a presenter to request these tokens and
   to subsequently use them with recipients.  Proof of possession only
   provides the intended security gains when the proof is known to be
   current and not subject to replay attacks; security protocols using
   mechanisms such as nonces and timestamps can be used to avoid the
   risk of replay when performing proof of possession for a token.  Note
   that a discussion of the architecture or specific protocols that CWTs
   with proof-of-possession keys are used with is beyond the scope of
   this specification.

   As is the case with other information included in a CWT, it is
   necessary to apply data origin authentication and integrity
   protection (via a keyed message digest or a digital signature).  Data
   origin authentication ensures that the recipient of the CWT learns
   about the entity that created the CWT, since this will be important
   for any policy decisions.  Integrity protection prevents an adversary
   from changing any elements conveyed within the CWT payload.  Special
   care has to be applied when carrying symmetric keys inside the CWT
   since those not only require integrity protection but also
   confidentiality protection.

   As described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> (Key Identification) and <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a> (Notes
   on Key Selection) of [<a href="#ref-JWS" title="&quot;JSON Web Signature (JWS)&quot;">JWS</a>], it is important to make explicit trust
   decisions about the keys.  Proof-of-possession signatures made with
   keys not meeting the application&#x27;s trust criteria MUST NOT be relied
   upon.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Privacy Considerations</span>

   A proof-of-possession key can be used as a correlation handle if the
   same key is used on multiple occasions.  Thus, for privacy reasons,
   it is recommended that different proof-of-possession keys be used
   when interacting with different parties.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Operational Considerations</span>

   The use of CWTs with proof-of-possession keys requires additional
   information to be shared between the involved parties in order to
   ensure correct processing.  The recipient needs to be able to use
   credentials to verify the authenticity and integrity of the CWT.
   Furthermore, the recipient may need to be able to decrypt either the
   whole CWT or the encrypted parts thereof (see <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>).  This
   requires the recipient to know information about the issuer.
   Likewise, there needs to be agreement between the issuer and the
   recipient about the claims being used (which is also true of CWTs in
   general).

   When an issuer creates a CWT containing a Key ID claim, it needs to
   make sure that it does not issue another CWT with different claims
   containing the same Key ID within the lifetime of the CWTs, unless
   intentionally desired.  Failure to do so may allow one party to
   impersonate another party, with the potential to gain additional
   privileges.  A case where such reuse of a Key ID would be intentional
   is when a presenter obtains a CWT with different claims (e.g.,
   extended scope) for the same recipient but wants to continue using an
   existing security association (e.g., a DTLS session) bound to the key
   identified by the Key ID.  Likewise, if PoP keys are used for
   multiple different kinds of CWTs in an application and the PoP keys
   are identified by Key IDs, care must be taken to keep the keys for
   the different kinds of CWTs segregated so that an attacker cannot
   cause the wrong PoP key to be used by using a valid Key ID for the
   wrong kind of CWT.  Using an audience restriction for the CWT would
   be one strategy to mitigate this risk.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>] basis
   after a three-week review period on the &lt;cwt-reg-review@ietf.org&gt;
   mailing list, on the advice of one or more designated experts.
   However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
   the designated experts may approve registration once they are
   satisfied that such a specification will be published.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., &quot;Request to Register CWT Confirmation
   Method: example&quot;).  Registration requests that are undetermined for a
   period longer than 21 days can be brought directly to IANA&#x27;s
   attention (using the iana@iana.org mailing list) for resolution.

   Designated experts should determine whether a registration request
   contains enough information for the registry to be populated with the
   new values and whether the proposed new functionality already exists.
   In the case of an incomplete registration or an attempt to register
   already existing functionality, the designated experts should ask for
   corrections or reject the registration.

   It is suggested that multiple designated experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   expert, that expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   experts.
