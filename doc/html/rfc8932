           <span class="h1">Recommendations for DNS Privacy Service Operators</span>

Abstract

   This document presents operational, policy, and security
   considerations for DNS recursive resolver operators who choose to
   offer DNS privacy services.  With these recommendations, the operator
   can make deliberate decisions regarding which services to provide, as
   well as understanding how those decisions and the alternatives impact
   the privacy of users.

   This document also presents a non-normative framework to assist
   writers of a Recursive operator Privacy Statement, analogous to DNS
   Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements
   described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc6841">RFC 6841</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is at the core of the Internet; almost
   every activity on the Internet starts with a DNS query (and often
   several).  However, the DNS was not originally designed with strong
   security or privacy mechanisms.  A number of developments have taken
   place in recent years that aim to increase the privacy of the DNS,
   and these are now seeing some deployment.  This latest evolution of
   the DNS presents new challenges to operators, and this document
   attempts to provide an overview of considerations for privacy-focused
   DNS services.

   In recent years, there has also been an increase in the availability
   of &quot;public resolvers&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8499" title="&quot;DNS Terminology&quot;">RFC8499</a>], which users may prefer to use
   instead of the default network resolver, either because they offer a
   specific feature (e.g., good reachability or encrypted transport) or
   because the network resolver lacks a specific feature (e.g., strong
   privacy policy or unfiltered responses).  These public resolvers have
   tended to be at the forefront of adoption of privacy-related
   enhancements, but it is anticipated that operators of other resolver
   services will follow.

   Whilst protocols that encrypt DNS messages on the wire provide
   protection against certain attacks, the resolver operator still has
   (in principle) full visibility of the query data and transport
   identifiers for each user.  Therefore, a trust relationship (whether
   explicit or implicit) is assumed to exist between each user and the
   operator of the resolver(s) used by that user.  The ability of the
   operator to provide a transparent, well-documented, and secure
   privacy service will likely serve as a major differentiating factor
   for privacy-conscious users if they make an active selection of which
   resolver to use.

   It should also be noted that there are both advantages and
   disadvantages to a user choosing to configure a single resolver (or a
   fixed set of resolvers) and an encrypted transport to use in all
   network environments.  For example, the user has a clear expectation
   of which resolvers have visibility of their query data.  However,
   this resolver/transport selection may provide an added mechanism for
   tracking them as they move across network environments.  Commitments
   from resolver operators to minimize such tracking as users move
   between networks are also likely to play a role in user selection of
   resolvers.

   More recently, the global legislative landscape with regard to
   personal data collection, retention, and pseudonymization has seen
   significant activity.  Providing detailed practice advice about these
   areas to the operator is out of scope, but <a href="#section-5.3.3">Section 5.3.3</a> describes
   some mitigations of data-sharing risk.

   This document has two main goals:

   *  To provide operational and policy guidance related to DNS over
      encrypted transports and to outline recommendations for data
      handling for operators of DNS privacy services.

   *  To introduce the Recursive operator Privacy Statement (RPS) and
      present a framework to assist writers of an RPS.  An RPS is a
      document that an operator should publish that outlines their
      operational practices and commitments with regard to privacy,
      thereby providing a means for clients to evaluate both the
      measurable and claimed privacy properties of a given DNS privacy
      service.  The framework identifies a set of elements and specifies
      an outline order for them.  This document does not, however,
      define a particular privacy statement, nor does it seek to provide
      legal advice as to the contents of an RPS.

   A desired operational impact is that all operators (both those
   providing resolvers within networks and those operating large public
   services) can demonstrate their commitment to user privacy, thereby
   driving all DNS resolution services to a more equitable footing.
   Choices for users would (in this ideal world) be driven by other
   factors -- e.g., differing security policies or minor differences in
   operator policy -- rather than gross disparities in privacy concerns.

   Community insight (or judgment?) about operational practices can
   change quickly, and experience shows that a Best Current Practice
   (BCP) document about privacy and security is a point-in-time
   statement.  Readers are advised to seek out any updates that apply to
   this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Scope</span>

   &quot;DNS Privacy Considerations&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7626" title="&quot;DNS Privacy Considerations&quot;">RFC7626</a>] describes the general privacy
   issues and threats associated with the use of the DNS by Internet
   users; much of the threat analysis here is lifted from that document
   and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>].  However, this document is limited in scope to best-
   practice considerations for the provision of DNS privacy services by
   servers (recursive resolvers) to clients (stub resolvers or
   forwarders).  Choices that are made exclusively by the end user, or
   those for operators of authoritative nameservers, are out of scope.

   This document includes (but is not limited to) considerations in the
   following areas:

   1.  Data &quot;on the wire&quot; between a client and a server.

   2.  Data &quot;at rest&quot; on a server (e.g., in logs).

   3.  Data &quot;sent onwards&quot; from the server (either on the wire or shared
       with a third party).

   Whilst the issues raised here are targeted at those operators who
   choose to offer a DNS privacy service, considerations for areas 2 and
   3 could equally apply to operators who only offer DNS over
   unencrypted transports but who would otherwise like to align with
   privacy best practice.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Privacy-Related Documents</span>

   There are various documents that describe protocol changes that have
   the potential to either increase or decrease the privacy properties
   of the DNS in various ways.  Note that this does not imply that some
   documents are good or bad, better or worse, just that (for example)
   some features may bring functional benefits at the price of a
   reduction in privacy, and conversely some features increase privacy
   with an accompanying increase in complexity.  A selection of the most
   relevant documents is listed in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> for reference.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   DNS terminology is as described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8499" title="&quot;DNS Terminology&quot;">RFC8499</a>], except with regard to
   the definition of privacy-enabling DNS server in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8499#section-6">Section&nbsp;6 of
   [RFC8499]</a>.  In this document we use the full definition of a DNS over
   (D)TLS privacy-enabling DNS server as given in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8310" title="&quot;Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS&quot;">RFC8310</a>], i.e., that
   such a server should also offer at least one of the credentials
   described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8310#section-8">Section&nbsp;8 of [RFC8310]</a> and implement the (D)TLS profile
   described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8310#section-9">Section&nbsp;9 of [RFC8310]</a>.

   Other Terms:

   RPS:  Recursive operator Privacy Statement; see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.

   DNS privacy service:  The service that is offered via a privacy-
      enabling DNS server and is documented either in an informal
      statement of policy and practice with regard to users privacy or a
      formal RPS.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Recommendations for DNS Privacy Services</span>

   In the following sections, we first outline the threats relevant to
   the specific topic and then discuss the potential actions that can be
   taken to mitigate them.

   We describe two classes of threats:

   *  Threats described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>], &quot;Privacy Considerations for
      Internet Protocols&quot;

      -  Privacy terminology, threats to privacy, and mitigations as
         described in Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a>, <a href="#section-5">5</a>, and <a href="#section-6">6</a> of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>].

   *  DNS Privacy Threats

      -  These are threats to the users and operators of DNS privacy
         services that are not directly covered by [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>].  These may
         be more operational in nature, such as certificate-management
         or service-availability issues.

   We describe three classes of actions that operators of DNS privacy
   services can take:

   *  Threat mitigation for well-understood and documented privacy
      threats to the users of the service and, in some cases, the
      operators of the service.

   *  Optimization of privacy services from an operational or management
      perspective.

   *  Additional options that could further enhance the privacy and
      usability of the service.

   This document does not specify policy, only best practice.  However,
   for DNS privacy services to be considered compliant with these best-
   practice guidelines, they SHOULD implement (where appropriate) all:

   *  Threat mitigations to be minimally compliant.

   *  Optimizations to be moderately compliant.

   *  Additional options to be maximally compliant.

   The rest of this document does not use normative language but instead
   refers only to the three differing classes of action that correspond
   to the three named levels of compliance stated above.  However,
   compliance (to the indicated level) remains a normative requirement.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  On the Wire between Client and Server</span>

   In this section, we consider both data on the wire and the service
   provided to the client.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.1" href="#section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  Transport Recommendations</span>

   Threats described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>]:
      Surveillance:
         Passive surveillance of traffic on the wire.

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      Active injection of spurious data or traffic.

   Mitigations:
      A DNS privacy service can mitigate these threats by providing
      service over one or more of the following transports:

      *  DNS over TLS (DoT) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7858" title="&quot;Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)&quot;">RFC7858</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8310" title="&quot;Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS&quot;">RFC8310</a>].

      *  DNS over HTTPS (DoH) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8484" title="&quot;DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)&quot;">RFC8484</a>].

   It is noted that a DNS privacy service can also be provided over DNS
   over DTLS [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8094" title="&quot;DNS over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)&quot;">RFC8094</a>]; however, this is an Experimental specification,
   and there are no known implementations at the time of writing.

   It is also noted that DNS privacy service might be provided over
   DNSCrypt [<a href="#ref-DNSCrypt" title="&quot;DNSCrypt - Official Project Home Page&quot;">DNSCrypt</a>], IPsec, or VPNs.  However, there are no specific
   RFCs that cover the use of these transports for DNS, and any
   discussion of best practice for providing such a service is out of
   scope for this document.

   Whilst encryption of DNS traffic can protect against active injection
   on the paths traversed by the encrypted connection, this does not
   diminish the need for DNSSEC; see <a href="#section-5.1.4">Section 5.1.4</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.2" href="#section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>.  Authentication of DNS Privacy Services</span>

   Threats described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>]:
      Surveillance:
         Active attacks on client resolver configuration.

   Mitigations:
      DNS privacy services should ensure clients can authenticate the
      server.  Note that this, in effect, commits the DNS privacy
      service to a public identity users will trust.

      When using DoT, clients that select a &quot;Strict Privacy&quot; usage
      profile [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8310" title="&quot;Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS&quot;">RFC8310</a>] (to mitigate the threat of active attack on the
      client) require the ability to authenticate the DNS server.  To
      enable this, DNS privacy services that offer DoT need to provide
      credentials that will be accepted by the client&#x27;s trust model, in
      the form of either X.509 certificates [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5280" title="&quot;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile&quot;">RFC5280</a>] or Subject Public
      Key Info (SPKI) pin sets [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8310" title="&quot;Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS&quot;">RFC8310</a>].

      When offering DoH [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8484" title="&quot;DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)&quot;">RFC8484</a>], HTTPS requires authentication of the
      server as part of the protocol.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.2.1" href="#section-5.1.2.1">5.1.2.1</a>.  Certificate Management</span>

   Anecdotal evidence to date highlights the management of certificates
   as one of the more challenging aspects for operators of traditional
   DNS resolvers that choose to additionally provide a DNS privacy
   service, as management of such credentials is new to those DNS
   operators.

   It is noted that SPKI pin set management is described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7858" title="&quot;Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)&quot;">RFC7858</a>]
   but that key-pinning mechanisms in general have fallen out of favor
   operationally for various reasons, such as the logistical overhead of
   rolling keys.

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      *  Invalid certificates, resulting in an unavailable service,
         which might force a user to fall back to cleartext.

      *  Misidentification of a server by a client -- e.g., typos in DoH
         URL templates [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8484" title="&quot;DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)&quot;">RFC8484</a>] or authentication domain names
         [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8310" title="&quot;Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS&quot;">RFC8310</a>] that accidentally direct clients to attacker-
         controlled servers.

   Mitigations:
      It is recommended that operators:

      *  Follow the guidance in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7525#section-6.5">Section&nbsp;6.5 of [RFC7525]</a> with regard to
         certificate revocation.

      *  Automate the generation, publication, and renewal of
         certificates.  For example, Automatic Certificate Management
         Environment (ACME) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8555" title="&quot;Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)&quot;">RFC8555</a>] provides a mechanism to actively
         manage certificates through automation and has been implemented
         by a number of certificate authorities.

      *  Monitor certificates to prevent accidental expiration of
         certificates.

      *  Choose a short, memorable authentication domain name for the
         service.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.3" href="#section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a>.  Protocol Recommendations</span>

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.3.1" href="#section-5.1.3.1">5.1.3.1</a>.  DoT</span>

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      *  Known attacks on TLS, such as those described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7457" title="&quot;Summarizing Known Attacks on Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS)&quot;">RFC7457</a>].

      *  Traffic analysis, for example: [<a href="#ref-Pitfalls-of-DNS-Encryption">Pitfalls-of-DNS-Encryption</a>]
         (focused on DoT).

      *  Potential for client tracking via transport identifiers.

      *  Blocking of well-known ports (e.g., 853 for DoT).

   Mitigations:
      In the case of DoT, TLS profiles from <a href="/doc/html/rfc8310#section-9">Section&nbsp;9 of [RFC8310]</a> and
      the &quot;Countermeasures to DNS Traffic Analysis&quot; from <a href="/doc/html/rfc8310#section-11.1">Section&nbsp;11.1 of
      [RFC8310]</a> provide strong mitigations.  This includes but is not
      limited to:

      *  Adhering to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7525" title="&quot;Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)&quot;">RFC7525</a>].

      *  Implementing only (D)TLS 1.2 or later, as specified in
         [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8310" title="&quot;Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS&quot;">RFC8310</a>].

      *  Implementing Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) Padding
         [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7830" title="&quot;The EDNS(0) Padding Option&quot;">RFC7830</a>] using the guidelines in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8467" title="&quot;Padding Policies for Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))&quot;">RFC8467</a>] or a successor
         specification.

      *  Servers should not degrade in any way the query service level
         provided to clients that do not use any form of session
         resumption mechanism, such as TLS session resumption [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5077" title="&quot;Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without Server-Side State&quot;">RFC5077</a>]
         with TLS 1.2 (<a href="/doc/html/rfc8446#section-2.2">Section&nbsp;2.2 of [RFC8446]</a>) or Domain Name System
         (DNS) Cookies [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7873" title="&quot;Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies&quot;">RFC7873</a>].

      *  A DoT privacy service on both port 853 and 443.  If the
         operator deploys DoH on the same IP address, this requires the
         use of the &quot;dot&quot; Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
         value [<a href="#ref-dot-ALPN" title="&quot;Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions: TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs&quot;">dot-ALPN</a>].

   Optimizations:
      *  Concurrent processing of pipelined queries, returning responses
         as soon as available, potentially out of order, as specified in
         [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7766" title="&quot;DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements&quot;">RFC7766</a>].  This is often called &quot;OOOR&quot; -- out-of-order
         responses (providing processing performance similar to HTTP
         multiplexing).

      *  Management of TLS connections to optimize performance for
         clients using [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7766" title="&quot;DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements&quot;">RFC7766</a>] and EDNS(0) Keepalive [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7828" title="&quot;The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option&quot;">RFC7828</a>]

   Additional Options:
      Management of TLS connections to optimize performance for clients
      using DNS Stateful Operations [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8490" title="&quot;DNS Stateful Operations&quot;">RFC8490</a>].

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.3.2" href="#section-5.1.3.2">5.1.3.2</a>.  DoH</span>

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      *  Known attacks on TLS, such as those described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7457" title="&quot;Summarizing Known Attacks on Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS)&quot;">RFC7457</a>].

      *  Traffic analysis, for example: [<a href="#ref-DNS-Privacy-not-so-private">DNS-Privacy-not-so-private</a>]
         (focused on DoH).

      *  Potential for client tracking via transport identifiers.

   Mitigations:
      *  Clients must be able to forgo the use of HTTP cookies [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6265" title="&quot;HTTP State Management Mechanism&quot;">RFC6265</a>]
         and still use the service.

      *  Use of HTTP/2 padding and/or EDNS(0) padding, as described in
         <a href="/doc/html/rfc8484#section-9">Section&nbsp;9 of [RFC8484]</a>.

      *  Clients should not be required to include any headers beyond
         the absolute minimum to obtain service from a DoH server.  (See
         Section 6.1 of [<a href="#ref-BUILD-W-HTTP">BUILD-W-HTTP</a>].)

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.4" href="#section-5.1.4">5.1.4</a>.  DNSSEC</span>

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      Users may be directed to bogus IP addresses that, depending on the
      application, protocol, and authentication method, might lead users
      to reveal personal information to attackers.  One example is a
      website that doesn&#x27;t use TLS or whose TLS authentication can
      somehow be subverted.

   Mitigations:
      All DNS privacy services must offer a DNS privacy service that
      performs Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
      validation.  In addition, they must be able to provide the DNSSEC
      Resource Records (RRs) to the client so that it can perform its
      own validation.

   The addition of encryption to DNS does not remove the need for DNSSEC
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4033" title="&quot;DNS Security Introduction and Requirements&quot;">RFC4033</a>]; they are independent and fully compatible protocols, each
   solving different problems.  The use of one does not diminish the
   need nor the usefulness of the other.

   While the use of an authenticated and encrypted transport protects
   origin authentication and data integrity between a client and a DNS
   privacy service, it provides no proof (for a nonvalidating client)
   that the data provided by the DNS privacy service was actually DNSSEC
   authenticated.  As with cleartext DNS, the user is still solely
   trusting the Authentic Data (AD) bit (if present) set by the
   resolver.

   It should also be noted that the use of an encrypted transport for
   DNS actually solves many of the practical issues encountered by DNS
   validating clients -- e.g., interference by middleboxes with
   cleartext DNS payloads is completely avoided.  In this sense, a
   validating client that uses a DNS privacy service that supports
   DNSSEC has a far simpler task in terms of DNSSEC roadblock avoidance
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8027" title="&quot;DNSSEC Roadblock Avoidance&quot;">RFC8027</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.5" href="#section-5.1.5">5.1.5</a>.  Availability</span>

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      A failing DNS privacy service could force the user to switch
      providers, fall back to cleartext, or accept no DNS service for
      the duration of the outage.

   Mitigations:
      A DNS privacy service should strive to engineer encrypted services
      to the same availability level as any unencrypted services they
      provide.  Particular care should to be taken to protect DNS
      privacy services against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, as
      experience has shown that unavailability of DNS resolving because
      of attacks is a significant motivation for users to switch
      services.  See, for example, Section IV-C of
      [<a href="#ref-Passive-Observations-of-a-Large-DNS">Passive-Observations-of-a-Large-DNS</a>].

      Techniques such as those described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7766#section-10">Section&nbsp;10 of [RFC7766]</a> can
      be of use to operators to defend against such attacks.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.6" href="#section-5.1.6">5.1.6</a>.  Service Options</span>

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      Unfairly disadvantaging users of the privacy service with respect
      to the services available.  This could force the user to switch
      providers, fall back to cleartext, or accept no DNS service for
      the duration of the outage.

   Mitigations:
      A DNS privacy service should deliver the same level of service as
      offered on unencrypted channels in terms of options such as
      filtering (or lack thereof), DNSSEC validation, etc.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.7" href="#section-5.1.7">5.1.7</a>.  Impact of Encryption on Monitoring by DNS Privacy Service</span>
<span class="h4">        Operators</span>

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      Increased use of encryption can impact a DNS privacy service
      operator&#x27;s ability to monitor traffic and therefore manage their
      DNS servers [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8404" title="&quot;Effects of Pervasive Encryption on Operators&quot;">RFC8404</a>].

   Many monitoring solutions for DNS traffic rely on the plaintext
   nature of this traffic and work by intercepting traffic on the wire,
   either using a separate view on the connection between clients and
   the resolver, or as a separate process on the resolver system that
   inspects network traffic.  Such solutions will no longer function
   when traffic between clients and resolvers is encrypted.  Many DNS
   privacy service operators still need to inspect DNS traffic -- e.g.,
   to monitor for network security threats.  Operators may therefore
   need to invest in an alternative means of monitoring that relies on
   either the resolver software directly, or exporting DNS traffic from
   the resolver using, for example, [<a href="#ref-dnstap" title="&quot;dnstap&quot;">dnstap</a>].

   Optimization:
      When implementing alternative means for traffic monitoring,
      operators of a DNS privacy service should consider using privacy-
      conscious means to do so.  See <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> for more details on
      data handling and the discussion on the use of Bloom Filters in
      <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.8" href="#section-5.1.8">5.1.8</a>.  Limitations of Fronting a DNS Privacy Service with a Pure TLS</span>
<span class="h4">        Proxy</span>

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      *  Limited ability to manage or monitor incoming connections using
         DNS-specific techniques.

      *  Misconfiguration (e.g., of the target-server address in the
         proxy configuration) could lead to data leakage if the proxy-
         to-target-server path is not encrypted.

   Optimization:
      Some operators may choose to implement DoT using a TLS proxy
      (e.g., [<a href="#ref-nginx" title="&quot;nginx news&quot;">nginx</a>], [<a href="#ref-haproxy" title="&quot;HAProxy - The Reliable, High Performance TCP/HTTP Load Balancer&quot;">haproxy</a>], or [<a href="#ref-stunnel" title="&quot;DNS over TLS&quot;">stunnel</a>]) in front of a DNS
      nameserver because of proven robustness and capacity when handling
      large numbers of client connections, load-balancing capabilities,
      and good tooling.  Currently, however, because such proxies
      typically have no specific handling of DNS as a protocol over TLS
      or DTLS, using them can restrict traffic management at the proxy
      layer and the DNS server.  For example, all traffic received by a
      nameserver behind such a proxy will appear to originate from the
      proxy, and DNS techniques such as Access Control Lists (ACLs),
      Response Rate Limiting (RRL), or DNS64 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6147" title="&quot;DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers&quot;">RFC6147</a>] will be hard or
      impossible to implement in the nameserver.

      Operators may choose to use a DNS-aware proxy, such as [<a href="#ref-dnsdist" title="&quot;dnsdist Overview&quot;">dnsdist</a>],
      that offers custom options (similar to those proposed in
      [<a href="#ref-DNS-XPF" title="&quot;DNS X-Proxied- For&quot;">DNS-XPF</a>]) to add source information to packets to address this
      shortcoming.  It should be noted that such options potentially
      significantly increase the leaked information in the event of a
      misconfiguration.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Data at Rest on the Server</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.1" href="#section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  Data Handling</span>

   Threats described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>]:
      *  Surveillance.

      *  Stored-data compromise.

      *  Correlation.

      *  Identification.

      *  Secondary use.

      *  Disclosure.

   Other Threats
      *  Contravention of legal requirements not to process user data.

   Mitigations:
      The following are recommendations relating to common activities
      for DNS service operators; in all cases, data retention should be
      minimized or completely avoided if possible for DNS privacy
      services.  If data is retained, it should be encrypted and either
      aggregated, pseudonymized, or anonymized whenever possible.  In
      general, the principle of data minimization described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>]
      should be applied.

      *  Transient data (e.g., data used for real-time monitoring and
         threat analysis, which might be held only in memory) should be
         retained for the shortest possible period deemed operationally
         feasible.

      *  The retention period of DNS traffic logs should be only as long
         as is required to sustain operation of the service and meet
         regulatory requirements, to the extent that they exist.

      *  DNS privacy services should not track users except for the
         particular purpose of detecting and remedying technically
         malicious (e.g., DoS) or anomalous use of the service.

      *  Data access should be minimized to only those personnel who
         require access to perform operational duties.  It should also
         be limited to anonymized or pseudonymized data where
         operationally feasible, with access to full logs (if any are
         held) only permitted when necessary.

   Optimizations:
      *  Consider use of full-disk encryption for logs and data-capture
         storage.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.2" href="#section-5.2.2">5.2.2</a>.  Data Minimization of Network Traffic</span>

   Data minimization refers to collecting, using, disclosing, and
   storing the minimal data necessary to perform a task, and this can be
   achieved by removing or obfuscating privacy-sensitive information in
   network traffic logs.  This is typically personal data or data that
   can be used to link a record to an individual, but it may also
   include other confidential information -- for example, on the
   structure of an internal corporate network.

   The problem of effectively ensuring that DNS traffic logs contain no
   or minimal privacy-sensitive information is not one that currently
   has a generally agreed solution or any standards to inform this
   discussion.  This section presents an overview of current techniques
   to simply provide reference on the current status of this work.

   Research into data minimization techniques (and particularly IP
   address pseudonymization/anonymization) was sparked in the late 1990s
   / early 2000s, partly driven by the desire to share significant
   corpuses of traffic captures for research purposes.  Several
   techniques reflecting different requirements in this area and
   different performance/resource trade-offs emerged over the course of
   the decade.  Developments over the last decade have been both a
   blessing and a curse; the large increase in size between an IPv4 and
   an IPv6 address, for example, renders some techniques impractical,
   but also makes available a much larger amount of input entropy, the
   better to resist brute-force re-identification attacks that have
   grown in practicality over the period.

   Techniques employed may be broadly categorized as either
   anonymization or pseudonymization.  The following discussion uses the
   definitions from <a href="/doc/html/rfc6973#section-3">[RFC6973], Section&nbsp;3</a>, with additional observations
   from [<a href="#ref-van-Dijkhuizen-et-al">van-Dijkhuizen-et-al</a>].

   *  Anonymization.  To enable anonymity of an individual, there must
      exist a set of individuals that appear to have the same
      attribute(s) as the individual.  To the attacker or the observer,
      these individuals must appear indistinguishable from each other.

   *  Pseudonymization.  The true identity is deterministically replaced
      with an alternate identity (a pseudonym).  When the
      pseudonymization schema is known, the process can be reversed, so
      the original identity becomes known again.

   In practice, there is a fine line between the two; for example, it is
   difficult to categorize a deterministic algorithm for data
   minimization of IP addresses that produces a group of pseudonyms for
   a single given address.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.3" href="#section-5.2.3">5.2.3</a>.  IP Address Pseudonymization and Anonymization Methods</span>

   A major privacy risk in DNS is connecting DNS queries to an
   individual, and the major vector for this in DNS traffic is the
   client IP address.

   There is active discussion in the space of effective pseudonymization
   of IP addresses in DNS traffic logs; however, there seems to be no
   single solution that is widely recognized as suitable for all or most
   use cases.  There are also as yet no standards for this that are
   unencumbered by patents.

   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> provides a more detailed survey of various techniques
   employed or under development in 2020.

<span class="h4">        Correlation Data</span>

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      *  Fingerprinting of the client OS via various means, including:
         IP TTL/Hoplimit, TCP parameters (e.g., window size, Explicit
         Congestion Notification (ECN) support, selective acknowledgment
         (SACK)), OS-specific DNS query patterns (e.g., for network
         connectivity, captive portal detection, or OS-specific
         updates).

      *  Fingerprinting of the client application or TLS library by, for
         example, HTTP headers (e.g., User-Agent, Accept, Accept-
         Encoding), TLS version/Cipher-suite combinations, or other
         connection parameters.

      *  Correlation of queries on multiple TCP sessions originating
         from the same IP address.

      *  Correlating of queries on multiple TLS sessions originating
         from the same client, including via session-resumption
         mechanisms.

      *  Resolvers _might_ receive client identifiers -- e.g., Media
         Access Control (MAC) addresses in EDNS(0) options.  Some
         customer premises equipment (CPE) devices are known to add them
         [<a href="#ref-MAC-address-EDNS">MAC-address-EDNS</a>].

   Mitigations:
      *  Data minimization or discarding of such correlation data.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.5" href="#section-5.2.5">5.2.5</a>.  Cache Snooping</span>

   Threats described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>]:
      Surveillance:
         Profiling of client queries by malicious third parties.

   Mitigations:
      See [<a href="#ref-ISC-Knowledge-database-on-cache-snooping">ISC-Knowledge-database-on-cache-snooping</a>] for an example
      discussion on defending against cache snooping.  Options proposed
      include limiting access to a server and limiting nonrecursive
      queries.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Data Sent Onwards from the Server</span>

   In this section, we consider both data sent on the wire in upstream
   queries and data shared with third parties.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3.1" href="#section-5.3.1">5.3.1</a>.  Protocol Recommendations</span>

   Threats described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>]:
      Surveillance:
         Transmission of identifying data upstream.

   Mitigations:
      The server should:

      *  implement QNAME minimization [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7816" title="&quot;DNS Query Name Minimisation to Improve Privacy&quot;">RFC7816</a>].

      *  honor a SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH set to 0 in a query containing the
         EDNS(0) Client Subnet (ECS) option (<a href="/doc/html/rfc7871#section-7.1.2">[RFC7871], Section&nbsp;7.1.2</a>).
         This is as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8310" title="&quot;Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS&quot;">RFC8310</a>] for DoT but applicable to any
         DNS privacy service.

   Optimizations:
      As per <a href="/doc/html/rfc7871#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of [RFC7871]</a>, the server should either:

      *  not use the ECS option in upstream queries at all, or

      *  offer alternative services, one that sends ECS and one that
         does not.

   If operators do offer a service that sends the ECS options upstream,
   they should use the shortest prefix that is operationally feasible
   and ideally use a policy of allowlisting upstream servers to which to
   send ECS in order to reduce data leakage.  Operators should make
   clear in any policy statement what prefix length they actually send
   and the specific policy used.

   Allowlisting has the benefit that not only does the operator know
   which upstream servers can use ECS, but also the operator can decide
   which upstream servers apply privacy policies that the operator is
   happy with.  However, some operators consider allowlisting to incur
   significant operational overhead compared to dynamic detection of ECS
   support on authoritative servers.

   Additional options:

   *  &quot;Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8198" title="&quot;Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache&quot;">RFC8198</a>] and
      &quot;NXDOMAIN: There Really Is Nothing Underneath&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8020" title="&quot;NXDOMAIN: There Really Is Nothing Underneath&quot;">RFC8020</a>] to reduce
      the number of queries to authoritative servers to increase
      privacy.

   *  Run a local copy of the root zone [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8806" title="&quot;Running a Root Server Local to a Resolver&quot;">RFC8806</a>] to avoid making
      queries to the root servers that might leak information.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3.2" href="#section-5.3.2">5.3.2</a>.  Client Query Obfuscation</span>

   Additional options:

   Since queries from recursive resolvers to authoritative servers are
   performed using cleartext (at the time of writing), resolver services
   need to consider the extent to which they may be directly leaking
   information about their client community via these upstream queries
   and what they can do to mitigate this further.  Note that, even when
   all the relevant techniques described above are employed, there may
   still be attacks possible -- e.g., [<a href="#ref-Pitfalls-of-DNS-Encryption">Pitfalls-of-DNS-Encryption</a>].  For
   example, a resolver with a very small community of users risks
   exposing data in this way and ought to obfuscate this traffic by
   mixing it with &quot;generated&quot; traffic to make client characterization
   harder.  The resolver could also employ aggressive prefetch
   techniques as a further measure to counter traffic analysis.

   At the time of writing, there are no standardized or widely
   recognized techniques to perform such obfuscation or bulk prefetches.

   Another technique that particularly small operators may consider is
   forwarding local traffic to a larger resolver (with a privacy policy
   that aligns with their own practices) over an encrypted protocol, so
   that the upstream queries are obfuscated among those of the large
   resolver.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3.3" href="#section-5.3.3">5.3.3</a>.  Data Sharing</span>

   Threats described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6973" title="&quot;Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC6973</a>]:
      *  Surveillance.

      *  Stored-data compromise.

      *  Correlation.

      *  Identification.

      *  Secondary use.

      *  Disclosure.

   DNS Privacy Threats:
      Contravention of legal requirements not to process user data.

   Mitigations:
      Operators should not share identifiable data with third parties.

      If operators choose to share identifiable data with third parties
      in specific circumstances, they should publish the terms under
      which data is shared.

      Operators should consider including specific guidelines for the
      collection of aggregated and/or anonymized data for research
      purposes, within or outside of their own organization.  This can
      benefit not only the operator (through inclusion in novel
      research) but also the wider Internet community.  See the policy
      published by SURFnet [<a href="#ref-SURFnet-policy">SURFnet-policy</a>] on data sharing for research
      as an example.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Recursive Operator Privacy Statement (RPS)</span>

   To be compliant with this Best Current Practice document, a DNS
   recursive operator SHOULD publish a Recursive operator Privacy
   Statement (RPS).  Adopting the outline, and including the headings in
   the order provided, is a benefit to persons comparing RPSs from
   multiple operators.

   <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a> provides a comparison of some existing policy and privacy
   statements.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Outline of an RPS</span>

   The contents of Sections <a href="#section-6.1.1">6.1.1</a> and <a href="#section-6.1.2">6.1.2</a> are non-normative, other
   than the order of the headings.  Material under each topic is present
   to assist the operator developing their own RPS.  This material:

   *  Relates _only_ to matters around the technical operation of DNS
      privacy services, and no other matters.

   *  Does not attempt to offer an exhaustive list for the contents of
      an RPS.

   *  Is not intended to form the basis of any legal/compliance
      documentation.

   <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a> provides an example (also non-normative) of an RPS
   statement for a specific operator scenario.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1.1" href="#section-6.1.1">6.1.1</a>.  Policy</span>

   1.  Treatment of IP addresses.  Make an explicit statement that IP
       addresses are treated as personal data.

   2.  Data collection and sharing.  Specify clearly what data
       (including IP addresses) is:

       *  Collected and retained by the operator, and for what period it
          is retained.

       *  Shared with partners.

       *  Shared, sold, or rented to third parties.

       In each case, specify whether data is aggregated, pseudonymized,
       or anonymized and the conditions of data transfer.  Where
       possible provide details of the techniques used for the above
       data minimizations.

   3.  Exceptions.  Specify any exceptions to the above -- for example,
       technically malicious or anomalous behavior.

   4.  Associated entities.  Declare and explicitly enumerate any
       partners, third-party affiliations, or sources of funding.

   5.  Correlation.  Whether user DNS data is correlated or combined
       with any other personal information held by the operator.

   6.  Result filtering.  This section should explain whether the
       operator filters, edits, or alters in any way the replies that it
       receives from the authoritative servers for each DNS zone before
       forwarding them to the clients.  For each category listed below,
       the operator should also specify how the filtering lists are
       created and managed, whether it employs any third-party sources
       for such lists, and which ones.

       *  Specify if any replies are being filtered out or altered for
          network- and computer-security reasons (e.g., preventing
          connections to malware-spreading websites or botnet control
          servers).

       *  Specify if any replies are being filtered out or altered for
          mandatory legal reasons, due to applicable legislation or
          binding orders by courts and other public authorities.

       *  Specify if any replies are being filtered out or altered for
          voluntary legal reasons, due to an internal policy by the
          operator aiming at reducing potential legal risks.

       *  Specify if any replies are being filtered out or altered for
          any other reason, including commercial ones.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1.2" href="#section-6.1.2">6.1.2</a>.  Practice</span>

   Communicate the current operational practices of the service.

   1.  Deviations.  Specify any temporary or permanent deviations from
       the policy for operational reasons.

   2.  Client-facing capabilities.  With reference to each subsection of
       <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>, provide specific details of which capabilities
       (transport, DNSSEC, padding, etc.) are provided on which client-
       facing addresses/port combination or DoH URI template.  For
       <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>, clearly specify which specific authentication
       mechanisms are supported for each endpoint that offers DoT:

       a.  The authentication domain name to be used (if any).

       b.  The SPKI pin sets to be used (if any) and policy for rolling
           keys.

   3.  Upstream capabilities.  With reference to <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>, provide
       specific details of which capabilities are provided upstream for
       data sent to authoritative servers.

   4.  Support.  Provide contact/support information for the service.

   5.  Data Processing.  This section can optionally communicate links
       to, and the high-level contents of, any separate statements the
       operator has published that cover applicable data-processing
       legislation or agreements with regard to the location(s) of
       service provision.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Enforcement/Accountability</span>

   Transparency reports may help with building user trust that operators
   adhere to their policies and practices.

   Where possible, independent monitoring or analysis could be performed
   of:

   *  ECS, QNAME minimization, EDNS(0) padding, etc.

   *  Filtering.

   *  Uptime.

   This is by analogy with several TLS or website-analysis tools that
   are currently available -- e.g., [<a href="#ref-SSL-Labs" title="&quot;SSL Server Test&quot;">SSL-Labs</a>] or [<a href="#ref-Internet.nl">Internet.nl</a>].

   Additionally, operators could choose to engage the services of a
   third-party auditor to verify their compliance with their published
   RPS.

                  Table 1: Classification of Techniques

   Legend of techniques:

   GA   = Google Analytics
   d    = dnswasher
   TC   = TCPdpriv
   C    = CryptoPAn
   TS   = TSA
   i    = ipcipher
   B    = Bloom filter

   The choice of which method to use for a particular application will
   depend on the requirements of that application and consideration of
   the threat analysis of the particular situation.

   For example, a common goal is that distributed packet captures must
   be in an existing data format, such as PCAP [<a href="#ref-pcap" title="&quot;Tcpdump &amp; Libpcap&quot;">pcap</a>] or Compacted-DNS
   (C-DNS) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8618" title="&quot;Compacted-DNS (C-DNS): A Format for DNS Packet Capture&quot;">RFC8618</a>], that can be used as input to existing analysis
   tools.  In that case, use of a format-preserving technique is
   essential.  This, though, is not cost free; several authors (e.g.,
   [<a href="#ref-Brekne-and-Arnes">Brekne-and-Arnes</a>]) have observed that, as the entropy in an IPv4
   address is limited, if an attacker can

   *  ensure packets are captured by the target and

   *  send forged traffic with arbitrary source and destination
      addresses to that target and

   *  obtain a de-identified log of said traffic from that target,

   any format-preserving pseudonymization is vulnerable to an attack
   along the lines of a cryptographic chosen-plaintext attack.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.1" href="#appendix-B.1">B.1</a>.  Categorization of Techniques</span>

   Data minimization methods may be categorized by the processing used
   and the properties of their outputs.  The following builds on the
   categorization employed in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6235" title="&quot;IP Flow Anonymization Support&quot;">RFC6235</a>]:

   Format-preserving.  Normally, when encrypting, the original data
      length and patterns in the data should be hidden from an attacker.
      Some applications of de-identification, such as network capture
      de-identification, require that the de-identified data is of the
      same form as the original data, to allow the data to be parsed in
      the same way as the original.

   Prefix preservation.  Values such as IP addresses and MAC addresses
      contain prefix information that can be valuable in analysis --
      e.g., manufacturer ID in MAC addresses, or subnet in IP addresses.
      Prefix preservation ensures that prefixes are de-identified
      consistently; for example, if two IP addresses are from the same
      subnet, a prefix preserving de-identification will ensure that
      their de-identified counterparts will also share a subnet.  Prefix
      preservation may be fixed (i.e., based on a user-selected prefix
      length identified in advance to be preserved ) or general.

   Replacement.  A one-to-one replacement of a field to a new value of
      the same type -- for example, using a regular expression.

   Filtering.  Removing or replacing data in a field.  Field data can be
      overwritten, often with zeros, either partially (truncation or
      reverse truncation) or completely (black-marker anonymization).

   Generalization.  Data is replaced by more general data with reduced
      specificity.  One example would be to replace all TCP/UDP port
      numbers with one of two fixed values indicating whether the
      original port was ephemeral (&gt;=1024) or nonephemeral (&gt;1024).
      Another example, precision degradation, reduces the accuracy of,
      for example, a numeric value or a timestamp.

   Enumeration.  With data from a well-ordered set, replace the first
      data item&#x27;s data using a random initial value and then allocate
      ordered values for subsequent data items.  When used with
      timestamp data, this preserves ordering but loses precision and
      distance.

   Reordering/shuffling.  Preserving the original data, but rearranging
      its order, often in a random manner.

   Random substitution.  As replacement, but using randomly generated
      replacement values.

   Cryptographic permutation.  Using a permutation function, such as a
      hash function or cryptographic block cipher, to generate a
      replacement de-identified value.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2" href="#appendix-B.2">B.2</a>.  Specific Techniques</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2.1" href="#appendix-B.2.1">B.2.1</a>.  Google Analytics Non-Prefix Filtering</span>

   Since May 2010, Google Analytics has provided a facility
   [<a href="#ref-IP-Anonymization-in-Analytics">IP-Anonymization-in-Analytics</a>] that allows website owners to request
   that all their users&#x27; IP addresses are anonymized within Google
   Analytics processing.  This very basic anonymization simply sets to
   zero the least significant 8 bits of IPv4 addresses, and the least
   significant 80 bits of IPv6 addresses.  The level of anonymization
   this produces is perhaps questionable.  There are some analysis
   results [<a href="#ref-Geolocation-Impact-Assessment">Geolocation-Impact-Assessment</a>] that suggest that the impact
   of this on reducing the accuracy of determining the user&#x27;s location
   from their IP address is less than might be hoped; the average
   discrepancy in identification of the user city for UK users is no
   more than 17%.

   Anonymization:  Format-preserving, Filtering (truncation).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2.2" href="#appendix-B.2.2">B.2.2</a>.  dnswasher</span>

   Since 2006, PowerDNS has included a de-identification tool, dnswasher
   [<a href="#ref-PowerDNS-dnswasher">PowerDNS-dnswasher</a>], with their PowerDNS product.  This is a PCAP
   filter that performs a one-to-one mapping of end-user IP addresses
   with an anonymized address.  A table of user IP addresses and their
   de-identified counterparts is kept; the first IPv4 user addresses is
   translated to 0.0.0.1, the second to 0.0.0.2, and so on.  The de-
   identified address therefore depends on the order that addresses
   arrive in the input, and when running over a large amount of data,
   the address translation tables can grow to a significant size.

   Anonymization:  Format-preserving, Enumeration.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2.3" href="#appendix-B.2.3">B.2.3</a>.  Prefix-Preserving Map</span>

   Used in [<a href="#ref-tcpdpriv" title="&quot;TCPDRIV - Program for Eliminating Confidential Information from Traces&quot;">tcpdpriv</a>], this algorithm stores a set of original and
   anonymized IP address pairs.  When a new IP address arrives, it is
   compared with previous addresses to determine the longest prefix
   match.  The new address is anonymized by using the same prefix, with
   the remainder of the address anonymized with a random value.  The use
   of a random value means that TCPdpriv is not deterministic; different
   anonymized values will be generated on each run.  The need to store
   previous addresses means that TCPdpriv has significant and unbounded
   memory requirements.  The need to allocate anonymized addresses
   sequentially means that TCPdpriv cannot be used in parallel
   processing.

   Anonymization:  Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2.4" href="#appendix-B.2.4">B.2.4</a>.  Cryptographic Prefix-Preserving Pseudonymization</span>

   Cryptographic prefix-preserving pseudonymization was originally
   proposed as an improvement to the prefix-preserving map implemented
   in TCPdpriv, described in [<a href="#ref-Xu-et-al" title="&quot;Prefix- preserving IP address anonymization: measurement-based security evaluation and a new cryptography-based scheme&quot;">Xu-et-al</a>] and implemented in the
   [<a href="#ref-Crypto-PAn">Crypto-PAn</a>] tool.  Crypto-PAn is now frequently used as an acronym
   for the algorithm.  Initially, it was described for IPv4 addresses
   only; extension for IPv6 addresses was proposed in [<a href="#ref-Harvan" title="&quot;Prefix- and Lexicographical-order-preserving IP Address Anonymization&quot;">Harvan</a>].  This
   uses a cryptographic algorithm rather than a random value, and thus
   pseudonymity is determined uniquely by the encryption key, and is
   deterministic.  It requires a separate AES encryption for each output
   bit and so has a nontrivial calculation overhead.  This can be
   mitigated to some extent (for IPv4, at least) by precalculating
   results for some number of prefix bits.

   Pseudonymization:  Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2.5" href="#appendix-B.2.5">B.2.5</a>.  Top-Hash Subtree-Replicated Anonymization</span>

   Proposed in [<a href="#ref-Ramaswamy-and-Wolf">Ramaswamy-and-Wolf</a>], Top-hash Subtree-replicated
   Anonymization (TSA) originated in response to the requirement for
   faster processing than Crypto-PAn.  It used hashing for the most
   significant byte of an IPv4 address and a precalculated binary-tree
   structure for the remainder of the address.  To save memory space,
   replication is used within the tree structure, reducing the size of
   the precalculated structures to a few megabytes for IPv4 addresses.
   Address pseudonymization is done via hash and table lookup and so
   requires minimal computation.  However, due to the much-increased
   address space for IPv6, TSA is not memory efficient for IPv6.

   Pseudonymization:  Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2.6" href="#appendix-B.2.6">B.2.6</a>.  ipcipher</span>

   A recently released proposal from PowerDNS, ipcipher [<a href="#ref-ipcipher1">ipcipher1</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-ipcipher2">ipcipher2</a>], is a simple pseudonymization technique for IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses.  IPv6 addresses are encrypted directly with AES-128 using
   a key (which may be derived from a passphrase).  IPv4 addresses are
   similarly encrypted, but using a recently proposed encryption
   [<a href="#ref-ipcrypt" title="&quot;ipcrypt: IP-format-preserving encryption&quot;">ipcrypt</a>] suitable for 32-bit block lengths.  However, the author of
   ipcrypt has since indicated [<a href="#ref-ipcrypt-analysis">ipcrypt-analysis</a>] that it has low
   security, and further analysis has revealed it is vulnerable to
   attack.

   Pseudonymization:  Format-preserving, cryptographic permutation.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2.7" href="#appendix-B.2.7">B.2.7</a>.  Bloom Filters</span>

   van Rijswijk-Deij et al. have recently described work using Bloom
   Filters [<a href="#ref-Bloom-filter">Bloom-filter</a>] to categorize query traffic and record the
   traffic as the state of multiple filters.  The goal of this work is
   to allow operators to identify so-called Indicators of Compromise
   (IOCs) originating from specific subnets without storing information
   about, or being able to monitor, the DNS queries of an individual
   user.  By using a Bloom Filter, it is possible to determine with a
   high probability if, for example, a particular query was made, but
   the set of queries made cannot be recovered from the filter.
   Similarly, by mixing queries from a sufficient number of users in a
   single filter, it becomes practically impossible to determine if a
   particular user performed a particular query.  Large numbers of
   queries can be tracked in a memory-efficient way.  As filter status
   is stored, this approach cannot be used to regenerate traffic and so
   cannot be used with tools used to process live traffic.

   Anonymized:  Generalization.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C" href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  Current Policy and Privacy Statements</span>

   A tabular comparison of policy and privacy statements from various
   DNS privacy service operators based loosely on the proposed RPS
   structure can be found at [<a href="#ref-policy-comparison">policy-comparison</a>].  The analysis is based
   on the data available in December 2019.

   We note that the existing policies vary widely in style, content, and
   detail, and it is not uncommon for the full text for a given operator
   to equate to more than 10 pages (A4 size) of text in a moderate-sized
   font.  It is a nontrivial task today for a user to extract a
   meaningful overview of the different services on offer.

   It is also noted that Mozilla has published a DoH resolver policy
   [<a href="#ref-DoH-resolver-policy">DoH-resolver-policy</a>] that describes the minimum set of policy
   requirements that a party must satisfy to be considered as a
   potential partner for Mozilla&#x27;s Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR)
   program.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-D" href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a>.  Example RPS</span>

   The following example RPS is very loosely based on some elements of
   published privacy statements for some public resolvers, with
   additional fields populated to illustrate what the full contents of
   an RPS might look like.  This should not be interpreted as

   *  having been reviewed or approved by any operator in any way

   *  having any legal standing or validity at all

   *  being complete or exhaustive

   This is a purely hypothetical example of an RPS to outline example
   contents -- in this case, for a public resolver operator providing a
   basic DNS Privacy service via one IP address and one DoH URI with
   security-based filtering.  It does aim to meet minimal compliance as
   specified in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-D.1" href="#appendix-D.1">D.1</a>.  Policy</span>

   1.  Treatment of IP addresses.  Many nations classify IP addresses as
       personal data, and we take a conservative approach in treating IP
       addresses as personal data in all jurisdictions in which our
       systems reside.

   2.  Data collection and sharing.

       a.  IP addresses.  Our normal course of data management does not
           have any IP address information or other personal data logged
           to disk or transmitted out of the location in which the query
           was received.  We may aggregate certain counters to larger
           network block levels for statistical collection purposes, but
           those counters do not maintain specific IP address data, nor
           is the format or model of data stored capable of being
           reverse-engineered to ascertain what specific IP addresses
           made what queries.

       b.  Data collected in logs.  We do keep some generalized location
           information (at the city / metropolitan-area level) so that
           we can conduct debugging and analyze abuse phenomena.  We
           also use the collected information for the creation and
           sharing of telemetry (timestamp, geolocation, number of hits,
           first seen, last seen) for contributors, public publishing of
           general statistics of system use (protections, threat types,
           counts, etc.).  When you use our DNS services, here is the
           full list of items that are included in our logs:

           *  Requested domain name -- e.g., example.net

           *  Record type of requested domain -- e.g., A, AAAA, NS, MX,
              TXT, etc.

           *  Transport protocol on which the request arrived -- i.e.,
              UDP, TCP, DoT, DoH

           *  Origin IP general geolocation information -- i.e.,
              geocode, region ID, city ID, and metro code

           *  IP protocol version -- IPv4 or IPv6

           *  Response code sent -- e.g., SUCCESS, SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN,
              etc.

           *  Absolute arrival time using a precision in ms

           *  Name of the specific instance that processed this request

           *  IP address of the specific instance to which this request
              was addressed (no relation to the requestor&#x27;s IP address)

           We may keep the following data as summary information,
           including all the above EXCEPT for data about the DNS record
           requested:

           *  Currently advertised BGP-summarized IP prefix/netmask of
              apparent client origin

           *  Autonomous system number (BGP ASN) of apparent client
              origin

           All the above data may be kept in full or partial form in
           permanent archives.

       c.  Sharing of data.  Except as described in this document, we do
           not intentionally share, sell, or rent individual personal
           information associated with the requestor (i.e., source IP
           address or any other information that can positively identify
           the client using our infrastructure) with anyone without your
           consent.  We generate and share high-level anonymized
           aggregate statistics, including threat metrics on threat
           type, geolocation, and if available, sector, as well as other
           vertical metrics, including performance metrics on our DNS
           Services (i.e., number of threats blocked, infrastructure
           uptime) when available with our Threat Intelligence (TI)
           partners, academic researchers, or the public.  Our DNS
           services share anonymized data on specific domains queried
           (records such as domain, timestamp, geolocation, number of
           hits, first seen, last seen) with our Threat Intelligence
           partners.  Our DNS service also builds, stores, and may share
           certain DNS data streams which store high level information
           about domain resolved, query types, result codes, and
           timestamp.  These streams do not contain the IP address
           information of the requestor and cannot be correlated to IP
           address or other personal data.  We do not and never will
           share any of the requestor&#x27;s data with marketers, nor will we
           use this data for demographic analysis.

   3.  Exceptions.  There are exceptions to this storage model: In the
       event of actions or observed behaviors that we deem malicious or
       anomalous, we may utilize more detailed logging to collect more
       specific IP address data in the process of normal network defense
       and mitigation.  This collection and transmission off-site will
       be limited to IP addresses that we determine are involved in the
       event.

   4.  Associated entities.  Details of our Threat Intelligence partners
       can be found at our website page (insert link).

   5.  Correlation of Data.  We do not correlate or combine information
       from our logs with any personal information that you have
       provided us for other services, or with your specific IP address.

   6.  Result filtering.

       a.  Filtering.  We utilize cyber-threat intelligence about
           malicious domains from a variety of public and private
           sources and block access to those malicious domains when your
           system attempts to contact them.  An NXDOMAIN is returned for
           blocked sites.

           i.   Censorship.  We will not provide a censoring component
                and will limit our actions solely to the blocking of
                malicious domains around phishing, malware, and exploit-
                kit domains.

           ii.  Accidental blocking.  We implement allowlisting
                algorithms to make sure legitimate domains are not
                blocked by accident.  However, in the rare case of
                blocking a legitimate domain, we work with the users to
                quickly allowlist that domain.  Please use our support
                form (insert link) if you believe we are blocking a
                domain in error.
