<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Abstract</span>

   This memo describes a straight-forward approach toward producing
   concise, yet descriptive, MIB modules.  It is intended that all
   future MIB modules be written in this format.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Historical Perspective</span>

   As reported in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1052">RFC 1052</a>, IAB Recommendations for the Development of
   Internet Network Management Standards [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;IAB Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network Management Standards&quot;">1</a>], a two-prong strategy for
   network management of TCP/IP-based internets was undertaken.  In the
   short-term, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1067">RFC 1067</a>, was to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.
   In the long-term, the use of the OSI network management framework was
   to be examined.  Two documents were produced to define the management
   information: <a href="/doc/html/rfc1065">RFC 1065</a>, which defined the Structure of Management
   Information (SMI), and <a href="/doc/html/rfc1066">RFC 1066</a>, which defined the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Both of these documents were designed so as
   to be compatible with both the SNMP and the OSI network management
   framework.

   This strategy was quite successful in the short-term: Internet-based
   network management technology was fielded, by both the research and
   commercial communities, within a few months.  As a result of this,
   portions of the Internet community became network manageable in a
   timely fashion.

   As reported in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1109">RFC 1109</a>, Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network
   Management Review Group [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network Management Review Group&quot;">2</a>], the requirements of the SNMP and the OSI
   network management frameworks were more different than anticipated.
   As such, the requirement for compatibility between the SMI/MIB and
   both frameworks was suspended.  This action permitted the operational
   network management framework, based on the SNMP, to respond to new
   operational needs in the Internet community by producing MIB-II.

   In May of 1990, the core documents were elevated to &quot;Standard
   Protocols&quot; with &quot;Recommended&quot; status.  As such, the Internet-standard
   network management framework consists of: Structure and
   Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets,
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title="and K. McCloghrie">3</a>], which describes how managed objects contained in the



<span class="grey">SNMP Working Group                                              [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-3" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc1212">RFC 1212</a>                Concise MIB Definitions               March 1991</span>


   MIB are defined; Management Information Base for Network Management
   of TCP/IP-based internets, which describes the managed objects
   contained in the MIB, <a href="/doc/html/rfc1156">RFC 1156</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets&quot;">4</a>]; and, the Simple Network
   Management Protocol, <a href="/doc/html/rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Simple Network Management Protocol&quot;">5</a>], which defines the protocol used to
   manage these objects.  Consistent with the IAB directive to produce
   simple, workable systems in the short-term, the list of managed
   objects defined in the Internet-standard MIB was derived by taking
   only those elements which are considered essential.  However, the SMI
   defined three extensibility mechanisms: one, the addition of new
   standard objects through the definitions of new versions of the MIB;
   two, the addition of widely-available but non-standard objects
   through the experimental subtree; and three, the addition of private
   objects through the enterprises subtree.  Such additional objects can
   not only be used for vendor-specific elements, but also for
   experimentation as required to further the knowledge of which other
   objects are essential.

   As more objects are defined using the second method, experience has
   shown that the resulting MIB descriptions contain redundant
   information.  In order to provide for MIB descriptions which are more
   concise, and yet as informative, an enhancement is suggested.  This
   enhancement allows the author of a MIB to remove the redundant
   information, while retaining the important descriptive text.

   Before presenting the approach, a brief presentation of columnar
   object handling by the SNMP is necessary.  This explains and further
   motivates the value of the enhancement.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Columnar Objects</span>

   The SNMP supports operations on MIB objects whose syntax is
   ObjectSyntax as defined in the SMI.  Informally stated, SNMP
   operations apply exclusively to scalar objects.  However, it is
   convenient for developers of management applications to impose
   imaginary, tabular structures on the ordered collection of objects
   that constitute the MIB.  Each such conceptual table contains zero or
   more rows, and each row may contain one or more scalar objects,
   termed columnar objects.  Historically, this conceptualization has
   been formalized by using the OBJECT-TYPE macro to define both an
   object which corresponds to a table and an object which corresponds
   to a row in that table.  (The ACCESS clause for such objects is
   &quot;not-accessible&quot;, of course.) However, it must be emphasized that, at
   the protocol level, relationships among columnar objects in the same
   row is a matter of convention, not of protocol.

   Note that there are good reasons why the tabular structure is not a
   matter of protocol.  Consider the operation of the SNMP Get-Next-PDU
   acting on the last columnar object of an instance of a conceptual



<span class="grey">SNMP Working Group                                              [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-4" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc1212">RFC 1212</a>                Concise MIB Definitions               March 1991</span>


   row; it returns the next column of the first conceptual row or the
   first object instance occurring after the table.  In contrast, if the
   rows were a matter of protocol, then it would instead return an
   error.  By not returning an error, a single PDU exchange informs the
   manager that not only has the end of the conceptual row/table been
   reached, but also provides information on the next object instance,
   thereby increasing the information density of the PDU exchange.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Row Deletion</span>

   Nonetheless, it is highly useful to provide a means whereby a
   conceptual row may be removed from a table. In MIB-II, this was
   achieved by defining, for each conceptual row, an integer-valued
   columnar object.  If a management station sets the value of this
   object to some value, usually termed &quot;invalid&quot;, then the effect is
   one of invalidating the corresponding row in the table.  However, it
   is an implementation-specific matter as to whether an agent removes
   an invalidated entry from the table.  Accordingly, management
   stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents
   that corresponds to entries not currently in use.  Proper
   interpretation of such entries requires examination of the columnar
   object indicating the in-use status.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Row Addition</span>

   It is also highly useful to have a clear understanding of how a
   conceptual row may be added to a table.  In the SNMP, at the protocol
   level, a management station issues an SNMP set operation containing
   an arbitrary set of variable bindings.  In the case that an agent
   detects that one or more of those variable bindings refers to an
   object instance not currently available in that agent, it may,
   according to the rules of the SNMP, behave according to any of the
   following paradigms:

          (1)  It may reject the SNMP set operation as referring to
               non-existent object instances by returning a response
               with the error-status field set to &quot;noSuchName&quot; and the
               error-index field set to refer to the first vacuous
               reference.

          (2)  It may accept the SNMP set operation as requesting the
               creation  of new object instances corresponding to each
               of the object instances named in the variable bindings.
               The value of each (potentially) newly created object
               instance is specified by the &quot;value&quot; component of the
               relevant variable binding.  In this case, if the request
               specifies a value for a newly (or previously) created
               object that it deems inappropriate by reason of value or

               syntax, then it rejects the SNMP set operation by
               responding with the error-status field set to badValue
               and the error-index field set to refer to the first
               offending variable binding.

          (3)  It may accept the SNMP set operation and create new
               object instances as described in (2) above and, in
               addition, at its discretion, create supplemental object
               instances to complete a row in a conceptual table of
               which the new object instances specified in the request
               may be a part.

   It should be emphasized that all three of the above behaviors are
   fully conformant to the SNMP specification and are fully acceptable,
   subject to any restrictions which may be imposed by access control
   and/or the definitions of the MIB objects themselves.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Defining Objects</span>

   The Internet-standard SMI employs a two-level approach towards object
   definition.  A MIB definition consists of two parts: a textual part,
   in which objects are placed into groups, and a MIB module, in which
   objects are described solely in terms of the ASN.1 macro OBJECT-TYPE,
   which is defined by the SMI.

   An example of the former definition might be:

          OBJECT:
          -------
               sysLocation { system 6 }

          Syntax:
               DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))

          Definition:
               The physical location of this node (e.g., &quot;telephone
               closet, 3rd floor&quot;).

          Access:
               read-only.

          Status:
               mandatory.

          An example of the latter definition might be:

               sysLocation OBJECT-TYPE
                   SYNTAX  DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))

          In the interests of brevity and to reduce the chance of
          editing errors, it would seem useful to combine the two
          definitions.  This can be accomplished by defining an

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Mapping of the SYNTAX clause</span>

   The SYNTAX clause, which must be present, defines the abstract data

   is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI purposely restricts the
   ASN.1 constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are made
   expressly for simplicity.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.2" href="#section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  Mapping of the ACCESS clause</span>

   The ACCESS clause, which must be present, defines the minimum level
   of support required for that object type.  As a local matter,
   implementations may support other access types (e.g., an
   implementation may elect to permitting writing a variable marked as
   read-only).  Further, protocol-specific &quot;views&quot; (e.g., those
   indirectly implied by an SNMP community) may make further
   restrictions on access to a variable.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.3" href="#section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a>.  Mapping of the STATUS clause</span>

   support required for that object type.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.4" href="#section-4.1.4">4.1.4</a>.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause</span>

   The DESCRIPTION clause, which need not be present, contains a textual
   definition of that object type which provides all semantic
   definitions necessary for implementation, and should embody any
   information which would otherwise be communicated in any ASN.1
   commentary annotations associated with the object.  Note that, in
   order to conform to the ASN.1 syntax, the entire value of this clause
   must be enclosed in double quotation marks, although the value may be
   multi-line.

   Further, note that if the MIB module does not contain a textual
   description of the object type elsewhere then the DESCRIPTION clause
   must be present.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.5" href="#section-4.1.5">4.1.5</a>.  Mapping of the REFERENCE clause</span>

   The REFERENCE clause, which need not be present, contains a textual
   cross-reference to an object defined in some other MIB module.  This
   is useful when de-osifying a MIB produced by some other organization.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.6" href="#section-4.1.6">4.1.6</a>.  Mapping of the INDEX clause</span>

   The INDEX clause, which may be present only if that object type
   corresponds to a conceptual row, defines instance identification
   information for that object type.  (Historically, each MIB definition
   contained a section entitled &quot;Identification of OBJECT instances for
   use with the SNMP&quot;.  By using the INDEX clause, this section need no
   longer occur as this clause concisely captures the precise semantics
   needed for instance identification.)

   If the INDEX clause is not present, and the object type corresponds
   to a non-columnar object, then instances of the object are identified

   by appending a sub-identifier of zero to the name of that object.
   Further, note that if the MIB module does not contain a textual
   description of how instance identification information is derived for
   columnar objects, then the INDEX clause must be present.

   To define the instance identification information, determine which
   object value(s) will unambiguously distinguish a conceptual row.  The
   syntax of those objects indicate how to form the instance-identifier:

          (1)  integer-valued: a single sub-identifier taking the
               integer value (this works only for non-negative
               integers);

          (2)  string-valued, fixed-length strings: `n&#x27; sub-identifiers,
               where `n&#x27; is the length of the string (each octet of the
               string is encoded in a separate sub-identifier);

          (3)  string-valued, variable-length strings: `n+1&#x27; sub-
               identifiers, where `n&#x27; is the length of the string (the
               first sub-identifier is `n&#x27; itself, following this, each
               octet of the string is encoded in a separate sub-
               identifier);

          (4)  object identifier-valued: `n+1&#x27; sub-identifiers, where
               `n&#x27; is the number of sub-identifiers in the value (the
               first sub-identifier is `n&#x27; itself, following this, each
               sub-identifier in the value is copied);

          (5)  NetworkAddress-valued: `n+1&#x27; sub-identifiers, where `n&#x27;
               depends on the kind of address being encoded (the first
               sub-identifier indicates the kind of address, value 1
               indicates an IpAddress); or,

          (6)  IpAddress-valued: 4 sub-identifiers, in the familiar
               a.b.c.d notation.

   Note that if an &quot;indextype&quot; value is present (e.g., INTEGER rather
   than ifIndex), then a DESCRIPTION clause must be present; the text
   contained therein indicates the semantics of the &quot;indextype&quot; value.

   By way of example, in the context of MIB-II [<a href="#ref-7" title="&quot;Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II&quot;">7</a>], the following INDEX
   clauses might be present:

                 objects under         INDEX clause
               -----------------       ------------
               ifEntry                 { ifIndex }
               atEntry                 { atNetIfIndex,
                                         atNetAddress }

               ipNetToMediaEntry       { ipNetToMediaIfIndex,
                                         ipNetToMediaNetAddress }

                                         tcpConnLocalPort,
                                         tcpConnRemoteAddress,
                                         tcpConnRemotePort }
               udpEntry                { udpLocalAddress,
                                         udpLocalPort }
               egpNeighEntry           { egpNeighAddr }


<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.7" href="#section-4.1.7">4.1.7</a>.  Mapping of the DEFVAL clause</span>

   The DEFVAL clause, which need not be present, defines an acceptable
   default value which may be used when an object instance is created at
   the discretion of the agent acting in conformance with the third
   paradigm described in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> above.

   During conceptual row creation, if an instance of a columnar object
   is not present as one of the operands in the correspondent SNMP set
   operation, then the value of the DEFVAL clause, if present, indicates
   an acceptable default value that the agent might use.

   The value of the DEFVAL clause must, of course, correspond to the
   SYNTAX clause for the object.  Note that if an operand to the SNMP
   set operation is an instance of a read-only object, then the error
   noSuchName will be returned.  As such, the DEFVAL clause can be used
   to provide an acceptable default value that the agent might use.

   It is possible that no acceptable default value may exist for any of
   the columnar objects in a conceptual row for which the creation of
   new object instances is allowed.  In this case, the objects specified
   in the INDEX clause must have a corresponding ACCESS clause value of
   read-write.

                      &quot;The type of mapping.

                      Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has
                      the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry
                      in the ipNetToMediaTable.  That is, it effectively
                      disassociates the interface identified with said
                      entry from the mapping identified with said entry.
                      It is an implementation-specific matter as to
                      whether the agent removes an invalidated entry
                      from the table.  Accordingly, management stations
                      must be prepared to receive tabular information
                      from agents that corresponds to entries not
                      currently in use.  Proper interpretation of such
                      entries requires examination of the relevant
                      ipNetToMediaType object.&quot;

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Appendix: DE-osifying MIBs</span>

   There has been an increasing amount of work recently on taking MIBs
   defined by other organizations (e.g., the IEEE) and de-osifying them
   for use with the Internet-standard network management framework.  The
   steps to achieve this are straight-forward, though tedious.  Of
   course, it is helpful to already be experienced in writing MIB
   modules for use with the Internet-standard network management
   framework.

   The first step is to construct a skeletal MIB module, e.g.,

               <a href="/doc/html/rfc1213">RFC1213</a>-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

               IMPORTS
                       experimental, OBJECT-TYPE, Counter
                           FROM <a href="/doc/html/rfc1155">RFC1155</a>-SMI;

                       -- contact IANA for actual number
               root    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { experimental xx }

               END



<span class="grey">SNMP Working Group                                             [Page 13]</span></pre>

   The next step is to categorize the objects into groups.  For
   experimental MIBs, optional objects are permitted.  However, when a
   MIB module is placed in the Internet-standard space, these optional
   objects are either removed, or placed in a optional group, which, if
   implemented, all objects in the group must be implemented.  For the
   first pass, it is wisest to simply ignore any optional objects in the
   original MIB: experience shows it is better to define a core MIB
   module first, containing only essential objects; later, if experience
   demands, other objects can be added.

   It must be emphasized that groups are &quot;units of conformance&quot; within a
   MIB: everything in a group is &quot;mandatory&quot; and implementations do
   either whole groups or none.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Managed Object Mapping</span>

   Next for each managed object class, determine whether there can exist
   multiple instances of that managed object class.  If not, then for
   each of its attributes, use the OBJECT-TYPE macro to make an
   equivalent definition.

   Otherwise, if multiple instances of the managed object class can
   exist, then define a conceptual table having conceptual rows each
   containing a columnar object for each of the managed object class&#x27;s
   attributes. If the managed object class is contained within the
   containment tree of another managed object class, then the assignment
   of an object type is normally required for each of the &quot;distinguished
   attributes&quot; of the containing managed object class.  If they do not
   already exist within the MIB module, then they can be added via the
   definition of additional columnar objects in the conceptual row
   corresponding to the contained managed object class.

   In defining a conceptual row, it is useful to consider the
   optimization of network management operations which will act upon its
   columnar objects.  In particular, it is wisest to avoid defining more
   columnar objects within a conceptual row, than can fit in a single
   PDU.  As a rule of thumb, a conceptual row should contain no more
   than approximately 20 objects.  Similarly, or as a way to abide by
   the &quot;20 object guideline&quot;, columnar objects should be grouped into
   tables according to the expected grouping of network management
   operations upon them.  As such, the content of conceptual rows should
   reflect typical access scenarios, e.g., they should be organized
   along functional lines such as one row for statistics and another row
   for parameters, or along usage lines such as commonly-needed objects
   versus rarely-needed objects.

   On the other hand, the definition of conceptual rows where the number
   of columnar objects used as indexes outnumbers the number used to

   hold information, should also be avoided.  In particular, the
   splitting of a managed object class&#x27;s attributes into many conceptual
   tables should not be used as a way to obtain the same degree of
   flexibility/complexity as is often found in MIB&#x27;s with a myriad of
   optionals.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.1" href="#section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  Mapping to the SYNTAX clause</span>

   When mapping to the SYNTAX clause of the OBJECT-type macro:

          (1)  An object with BOOLEAN syntax becomes an INTEGER taking
               either of values true(1) or false(2).

          (2)  An object with ENUMERATED syntax becomes an INTEGER,
               taking any of the values given.

          (3)  An object with BIT STRING syntax containing no more than
               32 bits becomes an INTEGER defined as a sum; otherwise if
               more than 32 bits are present, the object becomes an
               OCTET STRING, with the bits numbered from left-to-right,
               in which the least significant bits of the last octet may
               be &quot;reserved for future use&quot;.

          (4)  An object with a character string syntax becomes either
               an OCTET STRING or a DisplayString, depending on the
               repertoire of the character string.

          (5)  An non-tabular object with a complex syntax, such as REAL
               or EXTERNAL, must be decomposed, usually into an OCTET
               STRING (if sensible).  As a rule, any object with a
               complicated syntax should be avoided.

          (6)  Tabular objects must be decomposed into rows of columnar
               objects.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.2" href="#section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>.  Mapping to the ACCESS clause</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.3" href="#section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a>.  Mapping to the STATUS clause</span>

   This is usually straight-forward; however, some osified-MIBs use the

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Action Mapping</span>

   Actions are modeled as read-write objects, in which writing a

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.1" href="#section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  Mapping to the SYNTAX clause</span>

   Usually an INTEGER syntax is used with a distinguished value provided
   for each action that the object provides access to.  In addition,
   there is usually one other distinguished value, which is the one
   returned when the object is read.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2.2" href="#section-5.2.2">5.2.2</a>.  Mapping to the ACCESS clause</span>
