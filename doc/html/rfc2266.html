<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  The SNMP Network Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of several components.
   For the purpose of this specification, the applicable components of
   the Framework are the SMI and related documents [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Structure of Management Information for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)&quot;">2</a>, <a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)&quot;">3</a>, <a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Conformance Statements for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)&quot;">4</a>], which
   define the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the
   purpose of management.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Object Definitions</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base (MIB).  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [<a href="#ref-1" title=" International Organization for Standardization. International Standard 8824 (December">1</a>]
   defined in the SMI [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Structure of Management Information for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)&quot;">2</a>].  In particular, each object type is named by
   an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an IEEE
   802.12 repeater, as defined by <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>, &quot;RMAC Protocol&quot; in IEEE
   Standard 802.12-1995 [<a href="#ref-6" title="&quot;Demand Priority Access Method, Physical Layer and Repeater Specifications for 100 Mb/s Operation&quot;">6</a>].

   The definitions presented here are based on <a href="#section-13">Section 13</a>, &quot;Layer
   management functions and services&quot;, and Annex C, &quot;GDMO Specifications
   for Demand Priority Managed Objects&quot; of IEEE Standard 802.12-1995
   [<a href="#ref-6" title="&quot;Demand Priority Access Method, Physical Layer and Repeater Specifications for 100 Mb/s Operation&quot;">6</a>].

   Implementors of these MIB objects should note that the IEEE document
   explicitly describes (in the form of Pascal pseudocode) when, where,
   and how various repeater attributes are measured.  The IEEE document
   also describes the effects of repeater actions that may be invoked by
   manipulating instances of the MIB objects defined here.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc2266">RFC 2266</a>                IEEE 802.12 Repeater MIB            January 1998</span>


   The counters in this document are defined to be the same as those
   counters in IEEE Standard 802.12-1995, with the intention that the
   same instrumentation can be used to implement both the IEEE and IETF
   management standards.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Repeater Management Model</span>

   The model used in the design of this MIB allows for a managed system
   to contain one or more managed 802.12 repeaters, and one or more
   managed 802.12 repeater ports.

   A repeater port may be thought of as a source of traffic into a
   repeater in the system.  The vgRptrBasicPortTable contains entries
   for each physical repeater port in the managed system.  An
   implementor may choose to separate these ports into &quot;groups&quot;.  For
   example, a group may be used to represent a field-replaceable unit,
   so that the port numbering may match the numbering in the hardware
   implementation.  Note that this group mapping is recommended but
   optional.  An implementor may choose to put all of the system&#x27;s ports
   into a single group, or to divide the ports into groups that do not
   match physical divisions.  Each group within the system is uniquely
   identified by a group number.  Each port within a system is uniquely
   identified by a combination of group number and port number.  The
   method of numbering groups and ports is implementation-specific.
   Both groups and ports may be sparsely numbered.

   In addition to the externally visible ports, some implementations may
   have internal ports that are not obvious to the end-user but are
   nevertheless sources of traffic into the repeater system.  Examples
   include internal management ports, through which an agent
   communicates, and ports connecting to a backplane internal to the
   implementation.  It is the decision of the implementor to select the
   appropriate group(s) in which to place internal ports.

   Managed repeaters in the system are represented by entries in the
   vgRptrInfoTable.  There may be multiple repeaters in the managed
   system.  They are uniquely identified by a repeater number.  The
   method of numbering repeaters is implementation-specific.  Each port
   will either be associated with one of the repeaters, or isolated (a
   so-called &quot;trivial&quot; repeater).  The set of ports associated with a
   single repeater will be in the same contention domain, and will be
   participating in the same instance of the Demand Priority Access
   Method protocol.  The mapping of ports to repeaters may be static or
   dynamic.  A column in the vgRptrBasicPortTable,
   vgRptrPortRptrInfoIndex, indicates the repeater that the port is
   currently associated with.  The method for assigning a port to a
   repeater is implementation-specific.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc2266">RFC 2266</a>                IEEE 802.12 Repeater MIB            January 1998</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  MAC Addresses</span>

   All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB module are in
   &quot;canonical&quot; order defined by 802.1a, i.e., as if it were transmitted
   least significant bit first.  This is true even if the repeater is
   operating in token ring framing mode, which requires MAC addresses to
   be transmitted most significant bit first.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.3" href="#section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Master Mode and Slave Mode</span>

   In an IEEE 802.12 network, &quot;master&quot; devices act as network
   controllers to decide when to grant requesting end-nodes permission
   to transmit.  These master devices may be repeaters, or other active
   controller devices such as switches.

   Devices which do not act as network controllers, such as end-nodes or
   passive switches, are considered to be operating in &quot;slave&quot; mode.

   An 802.12 repeater always acts in &quot;master&quot; mode on its local ports,
   which may connect to end nodes, switch or other device ports acting
   in &quot;slave&quot; mode, or lower-level repeaters in a cascade.  It acts in
   &quot;slave&quot; mode on cascade ports, which may connect to an upper-level
   repeater in a cascade, or to switch or other device ports operating
   in &quot;master&quot; mode.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.4" href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>.  IEEE 802.12 Training Frames</span>

   Training frames are special MAC frames that are used only during link
   initialization.  Training frames are initially constructed by the
   device at the &quot;lower&quot; end of a link, which is the slave mode device
   for the link.  The training frame format is as follows:

       +----+----+------------+--------------+----------+-----+
       | DA | SA | Req Config | Allow Config |   Data   | FCS |
       +----+----+------------+--------------+----------+-----+

               DA = destination address (six octets)
               SA = source address (six octets)
               Req Config = requested configuration (2 octets)
               Allow Config = allowed configuration (2 octets)
               Data = data (594 to 675 octets)
               FCS = frame check sequence (4 octets)

   Training frames are always sent with a null destination address.  To
   pass training, an end node must use its source address in the source
   address field of the training frame.  A repeater may use a non-null

   The requested configuration field allows the slave mode device to
   inform the master mode device about itself and to request
   configuration options.  The training response frame from the master
   mode device contains the slave mode device&#x27;s requested configuration
   from the training request frame.  The currently defined format of the
   requested configuration field as defined in the IEEE Standard
   802.12-1995 standard is shown below.  Please refer to the most
   current version of the IEEE document for a more up to date
   description of this field.  In particular, the reserved bits may be
   used in later versions of the standard.

            the training initiator is compliant.  The current version
            is 100.  Note that because of the different bit ordering
            used in IEEE and IETF documents, this value corresponds
            to version 1.

   Again, note that the most recent version of the IEEE 802.12 standard
   should be consulted for the most up to date definition of the
   requested configuration and allowed configuration fields.

   The data field contains between 594 and 675 octets and is filled in
   by the training initiator.  The first 55 octets may be used for
   vendor specific protocol information.  The remaining octets are all
   zeros.  The length of the training frame combined with the
   requirement that 24 consecutive training frames be exchanged without
   error to complete training ensures that marginal links will not
   complete training.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.5" href="#section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Structure of the MIB</span>

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into OID subtrees, each of which
   contains a set of related objects within a broad functional category.
   These subtrees are intended for organizational convenience ONLY, and
   have no relation to the conformance groups defined later in the
   document.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.5.1" href="#section-2.5.1">2.5.1</a>.  Basic Definitions</span>

   The basic definitions include objects for managing the basic status
   and control parameters for each repeater within the managed system,
   for the port groups within the managed system, and for the individual
   ports themselves.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.5.2" href="#section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a>.  Monitor Definitions</span>

   The monitor definitions include monitoring statistics for each
   repeater within the system and for individual ports.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.5.3" href="#section-2.5.3">2.5.3</a>.  Address Tracking Definitions</span>

   This collection includes objects for tracking the MAC addresses of
   the DTEs attached to the ports within the system.

   Note that this MIB also includes by reference a collection of objects
   from the 802.3 Repeater MIB which may be used for mapping the
   topology of a network.  These definitions are based on a technology
   which has been patented by Hewlett-Packard Company (HP).  HP has
   granted rights to this technology to implementors of this MIB.  See
   [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Conditional Grant of Rights to Specific Hewlett-Packard Patents In Conjunction With the Internet Engineering Task Force&#x27;s Internet-Standard Network Management Framework&quot;">8</a>] and [<a href="#ref-9" title="421">9</a>] for details.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.6.1" href="#section-2.6.1">2.6.1</a>.  Relationship to MIB-II</span>

   It is assumed that a repeater implementing this MIB will also
   implement (at least) the &#x27;system&#x27; group defined in MIB-II [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets - MIB-II&quot;">5</a>].

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.6.1.1" href="#section-2.6.1.1">2.6.1.1</a>.  Relationship to the &#x27;system&#x27; group</span>

   In MIB-II, the &#x27;system&#x27; group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
   object in the &#x27;system&#x27; group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
   entity even if the entity&#x27;s sole functionality is management of
   repeaters.

   Note that all of the managed repeaters (i.e. entries in the
   vgRptrInfoTable) will normally exist within a single naming scope.
   Therefore, there will normally only be a single instance of each of
   the objects in the system group for the entire managed repeater
   system regardless of how many managed repeaters there are in the
   system.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc2266">RFC 2266</a>                IEEE 802.12 Repeater MIB            January 1998</span>


<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.6.1.2" href="#section-2.6.1.2">2.6.1.2</a>.  Relationship to the &#x27;interfaces&#x27; group</span>

   In MIB-II, the &#x27;interfaces&#x27; group is defined as being mandatory for
   all systems and contains information on an entity&#x27;s interfaces, where
   each interface is thought of as being attached to a &#x27;subnetwork&#x27;.
   (Note that this term is not to be confused with &#x27;subnet&#x27; which refers
   to an addressing partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of
   protocols.)

   This Repeater MIB uses the notion of ports on a repeater.  The
   concept of a MIB-II interface has NO specific relationship to a
   repeater&#x27;s port.  Therefore, the &#x27;interfaces&#x27; group applies only to
   the one (or more) network interfaces on which the entity managing the
   repeater sends and receives management protocol operations, and does
   not apply to the repeater&#x27;s ports.

   This is consistent with the physical-layer nature of a repeater.  An
   802.12 repeater has an RMAC implementation, which acts as the
   repeater end of the Demand Priority Access Method, but does not
   contain a DTE MAC implementation, and does not pass packets up to
   higher-level protocol entities for processing.

   (When a network management entity is observing a repeater, it may
   appear as though the repeater is passing packets to a higher-level
   protocol entity.  However, this is only a means of implementing
   management, and this passing of management information is not part of
   the repeater functionality.)

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.6.2" href="#section-2.6.2">2.6.2</a>.  Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB</span>

   An IEEE 802.12 repeater can be configured to operate in either
   ethernet or token ring framing mode.  This only affects the frame
   format and address bit order of the frames on the wire.  An 802.12
   network does not use the media access protocol for either ethernet or
   token ring.  Instead, IEEE 802.12 defines its own media access
   protocol, the Demand Priority Access Method (DPAM).

   There is an existing standards-track MIB module for instrumenting
   IEEE 802.3 repeaters [<a href="#ref-7" title="&quot;Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Repeater Devices&quot;">7</a>].  That MIB module is designed to instrument
   the operation of the repeater in a network implementing the 802.3
   media access protocol.  Therefore, much of that MIB does not apply to
   802.12 repeaters.

   However, the 802.3 Repeater MIB also contains a collection of objects
   that may be used to map the topology of a network.  These objects are
   contained in a separable OBJECT-GROUP, are not 802.3-specific, and
   are considered useful for 802.12 repeaters.  In addition, the layer

   management clause of the IEEE 802.12 specification includes similar
   functionality.  Therefore, vendors of agents for 802.12 repeaters are
   encouraged to implement the snmpRptrGrpRptrAddrSearch OBJECT-GROUP
   defined in the 802.3 Repeater MIB.

                      Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect.
                      The agent will always return the value noReset(1)
                      when this object is read.

                      After receiving a request to set this variable to
                      reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset
                      for a short period.  For example, the implementor
                      may choose to delay the reset long enough to
                      allow the SNMP response to be transmitted.  In
                      any event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

                      This action does not reset the management
                      counters defined in this document nor does it
                      affect the vgRptrPortAdminStatus parameters.
                      Included in this action is the execution of a
                      disruptive Self-Test with the following
                      characteristics:

                          1) The nature of the tests is not specified.
                          2) The test resets the repeater but without
                             affecting configurable management
                             information about the repeater.
                          3) Packets received during the test may or
                             may not be transferred.
                          4) The test does not interfere with
                             management functions.

                      After performing this self-test, the agent will
                      update the repeater health information (including
                      vgRptrInfoOperStatus), and send a

                      A status of notPresent(4) indicates that the

              DESCRIPTION
                      &quot;The vgRptrGroupPortCapacity is the number of
                      ports that can be contained within the group.
                      Valid range is 1-2147483647.  Within each group,
                      the ports are uniquely numbered in the range from
                      1 to vgRptrGroupPortCapacity.

                      Some ports may not be present in the system, in
                      which case the actual number of ports present will
                      be less than the value of vgRptrGroupPortCapacity.
                      The number of ports present is never greater than
                      the value of vgRptrGroupPortCapacity.

                      Note:  In practice, this will generally be the
                      number of ports on a module, card, or board, and
                      the port numbers will correspond to numbers marked
                      on the physical embodiment.&quot;

                      be repeated as the frame is being received.

                      Note that the value &#x27;someCablesBundled(1)&#x27; will
                      work in the vast majority of all installations,
                      regardless of whether or not any cables are
                      physically in a bundle, since packets received
                      from promiscuous and cascaded ports automatically
                      avoid the store and forward.  The main situation
                      in which &#x27;noCablesBundled(2)&#x27; is beneficial is
                      when there is a large amount of multicast traffic
                      and the cables are not in a bundle.

                      The value of this object should be preserved
                      across repeater resets and power failures.&quot;

                      disabled port will cause training to be
                      initiated by the training initiator (the slave
                      mode device) on the link.  Setting this object to
                      disabled(2) disables the port.

                      A disabled port neither transmits nor receives.
                      Once disabled, a port must be explicitly enabled
                      to restore operation.  A port which is disabled
                      when power is lost or when a reset is exerted
                      shall remain disabled when normal operation
                      resumes.

                      The value of this object should be preserved
                      across repeater resets and power failures.&quot;

                      The agent must reject a SET of this object if the

                      supported by this port&#x27;s hardware, as defined by
                      the values of the corresponding instances of
                      vgRptrPortSupportedPromiscMode and
                      vgRptrPortSupportedCascadeMode.

                      Note that vgRptrPortSupportPromiscMode and
                      vgRptrPortSupportedCascadeMode represent what the
                      port hardware is capable of supporting.
                      vgRptrPortAllowedTrainType is used for setting an
                      administrative policy for a port.  The actual set
                      of training configurations that will be allowed
                      to succeed on a port is the intersection of what
                      the hardware will support and what is
                      administratively allowed.  The above requirement
                      on what values may be set to this object says that
                      the intersection of what is supported and what is
                      allowed must be non-empty.  In other words, it
                      must not result in a situation in which nothing
                      would be allowed to train on that port.  However,
                      a value can be set to this object as long as the
                      combination of this object and what is supported
                      by the hardware would still leave at least one
                      configuration that could successfully train on the
                      port.

                      configuration field is described in <a href="#section-3.2">section 3.2</a>.
                      Please refer to the most recent version of the
                      IEEE 802.12 standard for the most up-to-date
                      definition of the format of this field.

                      If the port is in training, a management station
                      can examine this object to see if any training
                      packets have been passed successfully.  If there
                      have been any good training packets, the Valid
                      bit will be set and the management station can
                      examine the allowed configuration field to see if
                      there is a duplicate address, configuration, or
                      security problem.

                      Note that on a repeater local port, this repeater
                      generates the training response bits, while on
                      a cascade port, the device at the upper end of
                      the link originated the training response bits.&quot;

                      contained in high priority frames that have been
                      received on this port.  This counter is
                      incremented by OctetCount for each frame received
                      on this port which is counted by
                      vgRptrPortHighPriorityFrames.

                      This counter is a 64 bit version of
                      vgRptrPortHighPriorityOctets.  It should be used
                      by Network Management protocols which support
                      64 bit counters (e.g. SNMPv2).

                      &quot;This object is used to indicate that the
                      repeater detected an error-free training frame on

                      matches the value of vgRptrAddrLastTrainedAddress
                      of another active port in the same repeater.  This
                      is reset to &#x27;false&#x27; when an error-free training
                      frame is received with a non-null source MAC
                      address which does not match
                      vgRptrAddrLastTrainedAddress of another port which
                      is active in the same repeater.

                      if the &#x27;D&#x27; bit in the most recently received

                      the device at the other end of the link detected a
                      duplicate address itself, or, if the other device
                      is also a repeater, it could be because

                      The purpose of this object is to provide a means

                      not be informed of the duplicate address until it
                      retrains for some reason.  Note that regardless
                      of its station address, the end station will not
                      be able to train successfully until the network
                      management software has set this object back to
                      &#x27;false&#x27;.  Although this object exists on
                      cascade ports, it does not perform any function
                      since this repeater is the initiator of training
                      on a cascade port.&quot;

                      &quot;A vgRptrResetEvent trap conveys information
                      related to the operational state of a repeater.
                      This trap is sent on completion of a repeater
                      reset action.  A repeater reset action is defined
                      as a transition to its initial state as specified
                      in clause 12 [IEEE Std 802.12] when triggered by
                      a management command.

                      The vgRptrResetEvent trap is not sent when the
                      agent restarts and sends an SNMP coldStart or
                      warmStart trap.

                      The vgRptrResetEvent trap must contain the
                      instance of the vgRptrInfoOperStatus object
                      associated with the affected repeater.

                      The agent must throttle the generation of
                      consecutive vgRptrResetEvent traps so that there
                      is at least a five-second gap between traps of
                      this type.  When traps are throttled, they are

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information should be employed in such environments.  The method for
   this authentication is a function of the SNMP Administrative
   Framework, and has not been expanded by this MIB.

   Several objects in the vgRptrConfigGroup allow write access.  Setting
   these objects can have a serious effect on the operation of the
   network, including modifying the framing type of the network,
   resetting the repeater, enabling and disabling individual ports, and
   modifying the allowed capabilities of end stations attached to each
   port.  It is recommended that implementers seriously consider whether
   set operations should be allowed without providing, at a minimum,
   authentication of request origin.

   One particular object in this MIB, vgRptrPortAllowedTrainType, is
   considered significant for providing operational security in an
   802.12 network.  It is recommended that network administrators
   configure this object to the &#x27;allowEndNodesOnly&#x27; value on all ports
   except ports which the administrator knows are attached to cascaded
   repeaters or devices which require promiscuous receive capability
   (bridges, switches, RMON probes, etc.).  This will prevent
   unauthorized users from extending the network (by attaching cascaded
   repeaters or bridges) without the administrator&#x27;s knowledge, and will
   prevent unauthorized end nodes from listening promiscuously to
   network traffic.
