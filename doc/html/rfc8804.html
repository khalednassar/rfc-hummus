Abstract

   Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery
   Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer
   serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This document defines
   extensions to the CDNI Metadata Interface (MI) and the Footprint &amp;
   Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI).  These extensions are
   derived from requirements raised by Open Caching but are also
   applicable to CDNI use cases in general.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Streaming Video Alliance [<a href="#ref-SVA" title="&quot;Streaming Video Alliance&quot;">SVA</a>] is a global association that works
   to solve streaming video challenges in an effort to improve end-user
   experience and adoption.  The Open Caching Working Group [<a href="#ref-OCWG" title="&quot;Open Caching&quot;">OCWG</a>] of
   the Streaming Video Alliance [<a href="#ref-SVA" title="&quot;Streaming Video Alliance&quot;">SVA</a>] is focused on the delegation of
   video delivery requests from commercial CDNs to a caching layer at
   the ISP&#x27;s network.  Open Caching architecture is a specific use case
   of CDNI where the commercial CDN is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the
   ISP caching layer is the downstream CDN (dCDN).  The Open Caching
   Request Routing Functional Specification [<a href="#ref-OC-RR" title="&quot;Open Cache Request Routing Functional Specification&quot;">OC-RR</a>] defines the Request
   Routing process and the interfaces that are required for its
   provisioning.  This document defines the CDNI metadata object
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8006" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Metadata&quot;">RFC8006</a>] and the CDNI Footprint and Capabilities object [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8008" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics&quot;">RFC8008</a>]
   that are required for Open Caching Request Routing:

   *  Redirect Target Capability (for dCDN advertising redirect target
      address)

   *  Fallback Target Metadata (for uCDN configuring fallback target
      address)

   This document also registers CDNI Payload Types [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7736" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Media Type Registration&quot;">RFC7736</a>] for these
   defined objects.

   For consistency with other CDNI documents, this document follows the
   CDNI convention of uCDN (upstream CDN) and dCDN (downstream CDN) to
   represent the commercial CDN and ISP caching layer, respectively.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   FQDN    Fully Qualified Domain Name

   CDN     Content Delivery Network

   Additionally, this document reuses the terminology defined in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6707" title="&quot;Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Problem Statement&quot;">RFC6707</a>], [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7336" title="&quot;Framework for Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI)&quot;">RFC7336</a>], [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8006" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Metadata&quot;">RFC8006</a>], [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8007" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Control Interface / Triggers&quot;">RFC8007</a>], and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8008" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics&quot;">RFC8008</a>].
   Specifically, we use the following CDNI acronyms:

   FCI     Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (see
           [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8008" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics&quot;">RFC8008</a>])

   MI      Metadata Interface (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8006" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Metadata&quot;">RFC8006</a>])

   uCDN    Upstream CDN (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7336" title="&quot;Framework for Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI)&quot;">RFC7336</a>])

   dCDN    Downstream CDN (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7336" title="&quot;Framework for Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI)&quot;">RFC7336</a>])

   RT      Redirection Target.  Endpoint for redirection from uCDN to
           dCDN.

   RR      Request Router.  An element responsible for routing user
           requests, typically using HTTP redirect or DNS CNAME,
           depending on the use case.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Requirements Language</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Redirect Target Capability</span>

   Iterative CDNI Request Redirection is defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7336#section-1.1">Section&nbsp;1.1 of
   [RFC7336]</a> and elaborated by examples in Sections <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a> and <a href="#section-3.4">3.4</a> of
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7336" title="&quot;Framework for Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI)&quot;">RFC7336</a>].  A Redirection Target (RT) is defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7975#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of
   [RFC7975]</a> for Recursive Request Redirection as:

   |  The endpoint to which the User Agent is redirected.  In CDNI, an
   |  RT may point to a number of different components, some examples
   |  include a surrogate in the same CDN as the request router, a
   |  request router in a dCDN, or a surrogate in a dCDN.

   In this document, we adopt the same definition of the RT for the
   Iterative Request Redirect use case.  This use case requires the
   provisioning of the RT address to be used by the uCDN in order to
   redirect to the dCDN.  RT addresses can vary between different
   footprints (for example, between different regions), and they may
   also change over time (for example, as a result of network problems).
   Given this variable and dynamic nature of the redirect target
   address, it may not be suitable to advertise it during bootstrap.  A
   more dynamic and footprint-oriented interface is required.
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7336#section-4.3">Section&nbsp;4.3 of [RFC7336]</a> suggests that it could be one of the roles
   of the FCI [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8008" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics&quot;">RFC8008</a>].  Following this suggestion, we have therefore
   chosen to use the CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement
   interface for redirect target address advertisement.

   Use cases:

   *  Footprint: The dCDN may want to have a different target per
      footprint.  Note that a dCDN may spread across multiple
      geographies.  This makes it easier to route client requests to a
      nearby request router.  Though this can be achieved using a single
      canonical name and &quot;Geo DNS&quot;, such that in different geographies
      the same hostname is resolved to different IP address, that
      approach has limitations; for example, a client may be using a
      third-party DNS resolver, making it impossible for the redirector
      to detect where the client is located, or Geo DNS granularity may
      be too rough for the requirement of the application.

   *  Scaling: The dCDN may choose to scale its Request Routing service
      by deploying more request routers in new locations and advertise
      them via an updatable interface like the FCI.

   The Redirect Target capability object is used to indicate the target
   address the uCDN should use in order to redirect a client to the
   dCDN.  A target may be attached to a specific uCDN host, attached to
   a list of uCDN hosts, or used globally for all the hosts of the uCDN.

   When a dCDN is attaching the redirect target to a specific uCDN host
   or a list of uCDN hosts, the dCDN MUST advertise the hosts within the
   Redirect Target capability object as &quot;redirecting-hosts&quot;.  In this
   case, the uCDN can redirect to that dCDN address, only if the User
   Agent request was to one of these uCDN hosts.

   If the Redirect Target capability object does not contain a target or
   the target is empty, the uCDN MUST interpret it as &quot;no target
   available for these uCDN hosts for the specified footprint&quot;.  In case
   such a target was already advertised in a previous FCI object, the
   uCDN MUST interpret it as an update that deletes the previous
   redirect target.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  DNS Redirect Target</span>

   A redirect target for DNS redirection is an FQDN used as an alias in
   a CNAME record response (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1034" title="&quot;Domain names - concepts and facilities&quot;">RFC1034</a>]) of the uCDN DNS router.  Note
   that DNS routers make routing decisions based on either the DNS
   resolver&#x27;s IP address or the client IP subnet when EDNS0 client-
   subnet (ECS) is used (see [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7871" title="&quot;Client Subnet in DNS Queries&quot;">RFC7871</a>]).  The dCDN may choose to
   advertise redirect targets and footprints to cover both cases, such
   that the uCDN resolution would route the DNS query to different dCDN
   CNAMEs according to client subnet or dCDN resolver IP address.  This
   method further allows the dCDN DNS to optimize the resolution by
   localizing the target CNAMEs.  A uCDN implementation SHOULD prefer
   routing based on client IP subnet when the ECS option is present.  A
   dCDN implementation using the ECS option MUST be aware of the privacy
   drawbacks listed in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7871#section-2">Section&nbsp;2 of [RFC7871]</a> and SHOULD follow the
   guidelines provided in <a href="/doc/html/rfc7871#section-11.1">Section&nbsp;11.1 of [RFC7871]</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  HTTP Redirect Target</span>

   A redirect target for HTTP redirection is the URI to be used as the
   value for the Location header of an HTTP redirect 3xx response,
   typically a 302 (Found) (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2">Section&nbsp;7.1.2 of [RFC7231]</a> and
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6.4">Section&nbsp;6.4 of [RFC7231]</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.3" href="#section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Properties of Redirect Target Capability Object</span>

   The Redirect Target capability object consists of the following
   properties:

   Property:  redirecting-hosts

      Description:  One or more uCDN hosts to which this redirect target
         is attached.  A redirecting host SHOULD be a host that was
         published in a HostMatch object by the uCDN as defined in
         <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-4.1.2">Section&nbsp;4.1.2 of [RFC8006]</a>.

      Type:  A list of Endpoint objects (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-4.3.3">Section&nbsp;4.3.3 of [RFC8006]</a>)

      Mandatory-to-Specify:  No.  If absent or empty, the redirect
         target applies to all hosts of the redirecting uCDN.

   Property:  dns-target

      Description:
         Target CNAME record for DNS redirection.

      Type:
         DnsTarget object (see <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>)

      Mandatory-to-Specify:
         No.  If the dns-target is absent or empty, the uCDN MUST
         interpret it as &quot;no dns-target available&quot;.

   Property:  http-target

      Description:
         Target URI for an HTTP redirect.

      Type:
         HttpTarget object (see <a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a>)

      Mandatory-to-Specify:
         No.  If the http-target is absent or empty, the uCDN MUST
         interpret it as &quot;no http-target available&quot;.

   The following is an example of a Redirect Target capability object
   serialization that advertises a dCDN target address that is attached
   to a specific list of uCDN &quot;redirecting-hosts&quot;.  A uCDN host that is
   included in that list can redirect to the advertised dCDN redirect
   target.  The capabilities object is serialized as a JSON object as
   defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8008#section-5.1">Section&nbsp;5.1 of [RFC8008]</a>.

   {
     &quot;capabilities&quot;: [
       {

       }
     ]
   }

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.4" href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>.  DnsTarget Object</span>

   The DnsTarget object gives the target address for the DNS response to
   delegate from the uCDN to the dCDN.

   Property:  host

      Description:  The host property is a hostname or an IP address,
         without a port number.

      Type:  Endpoint object as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-4.3.3">Section&nbsp;4.3.3 of [RFC8006]</a>,
         with the limitation that it SHOULD NOT include a port number
         and, in case a port number is present, the uCDN MUST ignore it.

      Mandatory-to-Specify:  Yes.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.4.1" href="#section-2.4.1">2.4.1</a>.  DnsTarget Example</span>

   The following is an example of the DnsTarget object:

   {
      &quot;host&quot;: &quot;service123.ucdn.dcdn.example.com&quot;
   }

   The following is an example of a DNS query for uCDN address
   &quot;a.service123.ucdn.example.com&quot; and the corresponding CNAME
   redirection response:

   Query:
   a.service123.ucdn.example.com:
   type A, class IN

   Response:
   NAME: a.service123.ucdn.example.com, TYPE: CNAME, CLASS: IN,
   TTL: 120, RDATA: service123.ucdn.dcdn.example.com

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.5" href="#section-2.5">2.5</a>.  HttpTarget Object</span>

   The HttpTarget object gives the necessary information to construct
   the target Location URI for HTTP redirection.

   Property:  host

      Description:  Hostname or IP address and an optional port, i.e.,
         the host and port of the authority component of the URI as
         described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2">Section&nbsp;3.2 of [RFC3986]</a>.

      Type:  Endpoint object as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-4.3.3">Section&nbsp;4.3.3 of [RFC8006]</a>.

      Mandatory-to-Specify:  Yes.

   Property:  scheme

      Description:  A URI scheme to be used in the redirect response
         location construction.  When present, the uCDN MUST use the
         provided scheme in for HTTP redirection to the dCDN.

      Type:  A URI scheme as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.1">Section&nbsp;3.1 of [RFC3986]</a>,
         represented as a JSON string.  The scheme MUST be either &quot;http&quot;
         or &quot;https&quot;.

      Mandatory-to-Specify:  No.  If this property is absent or empty,
         the uCDN request router MUST use the same scheme as was used in
         the original request before redirection.

   Property:  path-prefix

      Description:  A path prefix for the HTTP redirect Location header.
         The original path is appended after this prefix.

      Type:  A prefix of a path-absolute as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.3">Section&nbsp;3.3 of
         [RFC3986]</a>.  The prefix MUST end with a trailing slash to
         indicate the end of the last path segment in the prefix.

      Mandatory-to-Specify:  No.  If this property is absent or empty,
         the uCDN MUST NOT prepend a path-prefix to the original content
         path, i.e., the original path MUST appear in the Location URI
         right after the authority component.

   Property:  include-redirecting-host

      Description:  A flag indicating whether or not to include the
         redirecting host as the first path segment after the path-
         prefix.  If set to true and a &quot;path-prefix&quot; is used, the uCDN
         redirecting host MUST be added as a separate path segment after
         the path-prefix and before the original URL path.  If set to
         true and there is no path-prefix, the uCDN redirecting host
         MUST be prepended as the first path segment in the redirect
         URL.

      Type:  Boolean.

      Mandatory-to-Specify:  No.  Default value is False.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.5.1" href="#section-2.5.1">2.5.1</a>.  HttpTarget Example</span>

   The following is an example of the HttpTarget object with a &quot;scheme&quot;,
   a &quot;path-prefix&quot;, and &quot;include-redirecting-host&quot; properties:

   {
      &quot;host&quot;: &quot;us-east1.dcdn.example.com&quot;,
      &quot;scheme&quot;: &quot;https&quot;,
      &quot;path-prefix&quot;: &quot;/cache/1/&quot;,
      &quot;include-redirecting-host&quot;: true
   }

   The following is an example of an HTTP request for content at uCDN
   host &quot;a.service123.ucdn.example.com&quot; and the corresponding HTTP
   response with a Location header, used for redirecting the client to
   the dCDN, constructed according to the HttpTarget object from the
   above example:

   Request:
   GET /vod/1/movie.mp4 HTTP/1.1
   Host: a.service123.ucdn.example.com

   Response:
   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: <a href="https://us-east1.dcdn.example.com/cache/1/a.service123.ucdn.example.com/vod/1/movie.mp4">https://us-east1.dcdn.example.com/cache/1/</a>
   <a href="https://us-east1.dcdn.example.com/cache/1/a.service123.ucdn.example.com/vod/1/movie.mp4">a.service123.ucdn.example.com/vod/1/movie.mp4</a>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.6" href="#section-2.6">2.6</a>.  Usage Example</span>

   Before requests can be routed from the uCDN to the dCDN, the CDNs
   must exchange service configurations between them.  Using the MI, the
   uCDN advertises out-of-band its hosts to the dCDN; each host is
   designated by a hostname and has its own specific metadata (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-4.1.2">Section&nbsp;4.1.2 of [RFC8006]</a>).  Using the FCI, the dCDN advertises
   (also out-of-band) the redirect target address defined in <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>
   for the relevant uCDN hosts.  The following is a generalized example
   of the message flow between a uCDN and a dCDN.  For simplicity, we
   focus on the sequence of messages between the uCDN and dCDN and not
   on how they are passed.

     dCDN                                                    uCDN
       +                                                       +
       |                                                       |
   (1) | MI:  host: s123.ucdn.example.com                      |
       |      host-metadata: &lt; metadata &gt;                      |
       &lt;-------------------------------------------------------+
       |                                                       |
   (2) | FCI:  capability-type: FCI.RedirectTarget             |

       |                                                       |
       |                                                       |
       +                                                       +

              Figure 1: Redirect Target Address Advertisement

   Explanation:

   (1)  The uCDN advertises a host (s123.ucdn.example.com) with the host
        metadata.

   (2)  The dCDN advertises its FCI objects to the uCDN, including a
        Redirect Target capability object that contains the redirect
        target address (us-east1.dcdn.example.com) specified for that
        uCDN host.

   Once the redirect target has been set, the uCDN can start redirecting
   user requests to the dCDN.  The following is a generic sequence of
   redirection using the host and redirect target that were advertised
   in Figure 1.

   End User                  dCDN                   uCDN RR
       +                       +                       +
       |                       |                       |
   (1) | Request sent s123.ucdn.example.com            |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------&gt;
       |                       |                       |
   (2) | Redirect to us-east1.dcdn.example.com         |
       &lt;-----------------------+-----------------------+
       |                       |                       |
   (3) | Request us-east1.dcdn.example.com             |
       +-----------------------&gt;                       |
       |                       |                       |
   (4) | Response              |                       |
       &lt;-----------------------+                       |
       |                       |                       |
       +                       +                       +

               Figure 2: Generic Request Redirection Sequence

   Explanation:

   (1)  The End User sends a request (DNS or HTTP) to the uCDN Request
        Router (RR).

   (2)  Using the previously advertised Redirect Target, the uCDN
        redirects the request to the dCDN.

   (3)  The End User sends a request to the dCDN.

   (4)  The dCDN either sends a response or reroutes it, for example, to
        a dCDN surrogate.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Fallback Target Server Address</span>

   Open Caching requires that the uCDN provides a fallback target server
   to the dCDN to be used in cases where the dCDN cannot properly handle
   the request.  To avoid redirect loops, the fallback target server&#x27;s
   address at the uCDN MUST be different from the original uCDN address
   from which the client was redirected to the dCDN.  The uCDN MUST
   avoid further redirection when receiving the client request at the
   fallback target.  The Fallback Target is defined as a generic
   metadata object (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-3.2">Section&nbsp;3.2 of [RFC8006]</a>).

   Use cases:

   *  Failover: A dCDN request router receives a request but has no
      caches to which it can route the request.  This can happen in the
      case of failures or temporary network overload.

   *  No coverage: A dCDN request router receives a request from a
      client located in an area inside the footprint but not covered by
      the dCDN caches or outside the dCDN footprint coverage.  In such
      cases, the router may choose to redirect the request back to the
      uCDN fallback address.

   *  Error: A cache may receive a request that it cannot properly
      serve, for example, some of the metadata objects for that service
      were not properly acquired.  In this case, the cache&#x27;s &quot;default
      action&quot; may be to &quot;redirect back to uCDN&quot;.

   The Fallback Target metadata object is used to indicate the target
   address the dCDN should redirect a client to when falling back to the
   uCDN.  The fallback target address is represented as an Endpoint
   object as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-4.3.3">Section&nbsp;4.3.3 of [RFC8006]</a>.

   In DNS redirection, a CNAME record is used as the fallback target
   address.

   In HTTP redirection, a hostname is used as the fallback target
   address.

   When using HTTP redirect to route a client request back to the uCDN,
   it is the dCDN&#x27;s responsibility to use the original URL path as the
   client would have used for the original uCDN request, stripping, if
   needed, the dCDN path-prefix and/or the uCDN hostname from the
   redirect URL that may have been used to request the content from the
   dCDN.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Properties of Fallback Target Generic Metadata Object</span>

   The MI.FallbackTarget generic metadata object consists of the
   following two properties:

   Property:  host

      Description:  Target address to which the dCDN can redirect the
         client.

      Type:  Endpoint object as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-4.3.3">Section&nbsp;4.3.3 of [RFC8006]</a>,
         with the limitation that in case of DNS delegation, it SHOULD
         NOT include a port number, and in case a port number is
         present, the dCDN MUST ignore it.

      Mandatory-to-Specify:  Yes.

   Property:  scheme

      Description:  A URI scheme to be used in the redirect response
         location construction.  When present, the dCDN MUST use this
         scheme in case of HTTP redirection to the uCDN fallback
         address.

      Type:  A URI scheme as defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.1">Section&nbsp;3.1 of [RFC3986]</a>,
         represented as a JSON string.  The scheme MUST be either &quot;http&quot;
         or &quot;https&quot;.

      Mandatory-to-Specify:  No.  In case of HTTP redirection to
         fallback, if this property is absent or empty, the dCDN
         redirecting entity MUST use the same scheme as in the request
         received by the dCDN.

   The following is an example of an MI.FallbackTarget generic metadata
   object that designates the host address the dCDN should use as
   fallback address to redirect back to the uCDN:

   {
       &quot;generic-metadata-type&quot;: &quot;MI.FallbackTarget&quot;,
       &quot;generic-metadata-value&quot;:
       {
           &quot;host&quot;: &quot;fallback-a.service123.ucdn.example&quot;,
           &quot;scheme&quot;: &quot;https&quot;
       }
   }

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Usage Example</span>

   The uCDN advertises out-of-band the fallback target address to the
   dCDN, so that the dCDN may redirect a request back to the uCDN in
   case the dCDN cannot serve it.  Using the MI, the uCDN advertises its
   hosts to the dCDN, along with their specific host metadata (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-4.1.2">Section&nbsp;4.1.2 of [RFC8006]</a>).  The Fallback Target generic metadata
   object is encapsulated within the &quot;host-metadata&quot; property of each
   host.  The following is an example of a message flow between a uCDN
   and a dCDN.  For simplicity, we focus on the sequence of messages
   between the uCDN and dCDN, not on how they are passed.

     dCDN                                                    uCDN
       +                                                       +

       Figure 3: Advertisement of Host Metadata with Fallback Target

   Explanation:

   (1)  The uCDN advertises a host (s123.ucdn.example.com) with the host
        metadata.  The host-metadata property contains an
        MI.FallbackTarget generic metadata object.

   (2)  The dCDN advertises its FCI objects to the uCDN, including a
        Redirect Target capability object that contains the redirect
        target address (us-east1.dcdn.example.com) specified for that
        uCDN host.

   The following is a generic sequence of redirection using the
   configurations that were advertised in Figure 3.  In this case, the
   dCDN redirects back to the uCDN fallback target address.

                  Figure 4: Redirection to Fallback Target

   Explanation:

   (1)  The End User sends a request (DNS or HTTP) to the uCDN Request
        Router (RR).

   (2)  Using the previously advertised Redirect Target, the uCDN
        redirects the request to the dCDN.

   (3)  The End User sends a request to the dCDN.

   (4)  The dCDN cannot handle the request and therefore redirects it
        back to the uCDN fallback target address.

   (5)  The End User sends the request to the uCDN fallback target
        address.

   (6)  The uCDN either sends a response or reroutes it, for example, to
        a uCDN surrogate.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  uCDN Addressing Considerations</span>

   When advertising fallback addresses to the dCDN, the uCDN SHOULD
   consider the failure use cases that may lead the dCDN to route
   requests to uCDN fallback.  In extreme dCDN network failures or under
   denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, requests coming from a large segment
   or multiple segments of the dCDN may be routed back to the uCDN.  The
   uCDN SHOULD therefore design its fallback addressing scheme and its
   available resources accordingly.  A favorable approach would be for
   the uCDN to use a different fallback target address for each uCDN
   host, enabling it to load balance the requests using the same methods
   as it would for its original hosts.  See Sections <a href="#section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a> and <a href="#section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a> of
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8006" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Metadata&quot;">RFC8006</a>] for a detailed description of how to use GenericMetadata
   objects within the HostMatch object advertised in the HostIndex of
   the uCDN.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  CDNI Payload Types</span>

   IANA has registered the following CDNI Payload Types in the &quot;CDNI
   Payload Types&quot; registry defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7736" title="&quot;Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Media Type Registration&quot;">RFC7736</a>]:

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  CDNI FCI RedirectTarget Payload Type</span>

   Purpose:  The purpose of this payload type is to distinguish FCI
      advertisement objects for redirect target.

   Interface:  FCI

   Encoding:  See <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.2" href="#section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  CDNI MI FallbackTarget Payload Type</span>

   Purpose:  The purpose of this payload type is to distinguish
      FallbackTarget MI objects (and any associated capability
      advertisement).

   Interface:  MI/FCI

   Encoding:  See <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This specification defines extensions to the CDNI Metadata Interface
   (MI) and the Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI).
   As such, it is subject to the security and privacy considerations
   defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-8">Section&nbsp;8 of [RFC8006]</a> and in <a href="/doc/html/rfc8008#section-7">Section&nbsp;7 of [RFC8008]</a>,
   respectively.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Confidentiality and Privacy</span>

   The Redirect Target capability object potentially reveals information
   about the internal structure of the dCDN network.  A third party
   could intercept the FCI transactions and use the information to
   attack the dCDN.  The same is also true for the Fallback Target
   generic metadata object, as it may reveal information about the
   internal structure of the uCDN, exposing it to external exploits.
   Implementations of the FCI and MI MUST therefore use strong
   authentication and encryption and strictly follow the directions for
   securing the interface as defined for the Metadata Interface in
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8006#section-8.3">Section&nbsp;8.3 of [RFC8006]</a>.
