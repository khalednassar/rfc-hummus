Abstract

   This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable network
   security protocols, with a focus on how they interact and integrate
   with applications and transport protocols.  Its goal is to supplement
   efforts to define and catalog Transport Services by describing the
   interfaces required to add security protocols.  This survey is not
   limited to protocols developed within the scope or context of the
   IETF, and those included represent a superset of features a Transport
   Services system may need to support.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Services and features provided by transport protocols have been
   cataloged in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8095" title="&quot;Services Provided by IETF Transport Protocols and Congestion Control Mechanisms&quot;">RFC8095</a>].  This document supplements that work by
   surveying commonly used and notable network security protocols, and
   identifying the interfaces between these protocols and both transport
   protocols and applications.  It examines Transport Layer Security
   (TLS), Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), IETF QUIC, Google
   QUIC (gQUIC), tcpcrypt, Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), Secure
   Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) with DTLS, WireGuard, CurveCP,
   and MinimaLT.  For each protocol, this document provides a brief
   description.  Then, it describes the interfaces between these
   protocols and transports in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> and the interfaces between
   these protocols and applications in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   A Transport Services system exposes an interface for applications to
   access various (secure) transport protocol features.  The security
   protocols included in this survey represent a superset of
   functionality and features a Transport Services system may need to
   support both internally and externally (via an API) for applications
   [<a href="#ref-TAPS-ARCH">TAPS-ARCH</a>].  Ubiquitous IETF protocols such as (D)TLS, as well as
   non-standard protocols such as gQUIC, are included despite
   overlapping features.  As such, this survey is not limited to
   protocols developed within the scope or context of the IETF.  Outside
   of this candidate set, protocols that do not offer new features are
   omitted.  For example, newer protocols such as WireGuard make unique
   design choices that have implications for and limitations on
   application usage.  In contrast, protocols such as secure shell (SSH)
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4253" title="&quot;The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol&quot;">RFC4253</a>], GRE [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2890" title="&quot;Key and Sequence Number Extensions to GRE&quot;">RFC2890</a>], the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5641" title="&quot;Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3) Extended Circuit Status Values&quot;">RFC5641</a>], and Application Layer Transport Security (ALTS) [<a href="#ref-ALTS" title="&quot;Application Layer Transport Security&quot;">ALTS</a>] are
   omitted since they do not provide interfaces deemed unique.

   Authentication-only protocols such as the TCP Authentication Option
   (TCP-AO) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5925" title="&quot;The TCP Authentication Option&quot;">RFC5925</a>] and the IPsec Authentication Header (AH) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4302" title="&quot;IP Authentication Header&quot;">RFC4302</a>]
   are excluded from this survey.  TCP-AO adds authentication to long-
   lived TCP connections, e.g., replay protection with per-packet
   Message Authentication Codes.  (TCP-AO obsoletes TCP MD5 &quot;signature&quot;
   options specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2385" title="&quot;Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature Option&quot;">RFC2385</a>].)  One primary use case of TCP-AO is
   for protecting BGP connections.  Similarly, AH adds per-datagram
   authentication and integrity, along with replay protection.  Despite
   these improvements, neither protocol sees general use and both lack
   critical properties important for emergent transport security
   protocols, such as confidentiality and privacy protections.  Such
   protocols are thus omitted from this survey.

   This document only surveys point-to-point protocols; multicast
   protocols are out of scope.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Goals</span>

   This survey is intended to help identify the most common interface
   surfaces between security protocols and transport protocols, and
   between security protocols and applications.

   One of the goals of the Transport Services effort is to define a
   common interface for using transport protocols that allows software
   using transport protocols to easily adopt new protocols that provide
   similar feature sets.  The survey of the dependencies security
   protocols have upon transport protocols can guide implementations in
   determining which transport protocols are appropriate to be able to
   use beneath a given security protocol.  For example, a security
   protocol that expects to run over a reliable stream of bytes, like
   TLS, restricts the set of transport protocols that can be used to
   those that offer a reliable stream of bytes.

   Defining the common interfaces that security protocols provide to
   applications also allows interfaces to be designed in a way that
   common functionality can use the same APIs.  For example, many
   security protocols that provide authentication let the application be
   involved in peer identity validation.  Any interface to use a secure
   transport protocol stack thus needs to allow applications to perform
   this action during connection establishment.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Non-goals</span>

   While this survey provides similar analysis to that which was
   performed for transport protocols in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8095" title="&quot;Services Provided by IETF Transport Protocols and Congestion Control Mechanisms&quot;">RFC8095</a>], it is important to
   distinguish that the use of security protocols requires more
   consideration.

   It is not a goal to allow software implementations to automatically
   switch between different security protocols, even where their
   interfaces to transport and applications are equivalent.  Even
   between versions, security protocols have subtly different guarantees
   and vulnerabilities.  Thus, any implementation needs to only use the
   set of protocols and algorithms that are requested by applications or
   by a system policy.

   Different security protocols also can use incompatible notions of
   peer identity and authentication, and cryptographic options.  It is
   not a goal to identify a common set of representations for these
   concepts.

   The protocols surveyed in this document represent a superset of
   functionality and features a Transport Services system may need to
   support.  It does not list all transport protocols that a Transport
   Services system may need to implement, nor does it mandate that a
   Transport Service system implement any particular protocol.

   A Transport Services system may implement any secure transport
   protocol that provides the described features.  In doing so, it may
   need to expose an interface to the application to configure these
   features.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the
   roles and interactions of transport security protocols (some of which
   are also defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8095" title="&quot;Services Provided by IETF Transport Protocols and Congestion Control Mechanisms&quot;">RFC8095</a>]):

   Transport Feature:  a specific end-to-end feature that the transport
      layer provides to an application.  Examples include
      confidentiality, reliable delivery, ordered delivery, and message-
      versus-stream orientation.

   Transport Service:  a set of Transport Features, without an
      association to any given framing protocol, that provides
      functionality to an application.

   Transport Services system:  a software component that exposes an
      interface to different Transport Services to an application.

   Transport Protocol:  an implementation that provides one or more
      different Transport Services using a specific framing and header
      format on the wire.  A Transport Protocol services an application,
      whether directly or in conjunction with a security protocol.

   Application:  an entity that uses a transport protocol for end-to-end
      delivery of data across the network.  This may also be an upper
      layer protocol or tunnel encapsulation.

   Security Protocol:  a defined network protocol that implements one or
      more security features, such as authentication, encryption, key
      generation, session resumption, and privacy.  Security protocols
      may be used alongside transport protocols, and in combination with
      other security protocols when appropriate.

   Handshake Protocol:  a protocol that enables peers to validate each
      other and to securely establish shared cryptographic context.

   Record:  framed protocol messages.

   Record Protocol:  a security protocol that allows data to be divided
      into manageable blocks and protected using shared cryptographic
      context.

   Session:  an ephemeral security association between applications.

   Connection:  the shared state of two or more endpoints that persists
      across messages that are transmitted between these endpoints.  A
      connection is a transient participant of a session, and a session
      generally lasts between connection instances.

   Peer:  an endpoint application party to a session.

   Client:  the peer responsible for initiating a session.

   Server:  the peer responsible for responding to a session initiation.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Transport Security Protocol Descriptions</span>

   This section contains brief transport and security descriptions of
   various security protocols currently used to protect data being sent
   over a network.  These protocols are grouped based on where in the
   protocol stack they are implemented, which influences which parts of
   a packet they protect: Generic application payload, application
   payload for specific application-layer protocols, both application
   payload and transport headers, or entire IP packets.

   Note that not all security protocols can be easily categorized, e.g.,
   as some protocols can be used in different ways or in combination
   with other protocols.  One major reason for this is that channel
   security protocols often consist of two components:

   *  A handshake protocol, which is responsible for negotiating
      parameters, authenticating the endpoints, and establishing shared
      keys.

   *  A record protocol, which is used to encrypt traffic using keys and
      parameters provided by the handshake protocol.

   For some protocols, such as tcpcrypt, these two components are
   tightly integrated.  In contrast, for IPsec, these components are
   implemented in separate protocols: AH and the Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) are record protocols, which can use keys supplied by
   the handshake protocol Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
   (IKEv2), by other handshake protocols, or by manual configuration.
   Moreover, some protocols can be used in different ways: While the
   base TLS protocol as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8446" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">RFC8446</a>] has an integrated handshake
   and record protocol, TLS or DTLS can also be used to negotiate keys
   for other protocols, as in DTLS-SRTP, or the handshake protocol can
   be used with a separate record layer, as in QUIC [<a href="#ref-QUIC-TRANSPORT">QUIC-TRANSPORT</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Application Payload Security Protocols</span>

   The following protocols provide security that protects application
   payloads sent over a transport.  They do not specifically protect any
   headers used for transport-layer functionality.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.1" href="#section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  TLS</span>

   TLS (Transport Layer Security) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8446" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">RFC8446</a>] is a common protocol used to
   establish a secure session between two endpoints.  Communication over
   this session prevents &quot;eavesdropping, tampering, and message
   forgery.&quot;  TLS consists of a tightly coupled handshake and record
   protocol.  The handshake protocol is used to authenticate peers,
   negotiate protocol options such as cryptographic algorithms, and
   derive session-specific keying material.  The record protocol is used
   to marshal and, once the handshake has sufficiently progressed,
   encrypt data from one peer to the other.  This data may contain
   handshake messages or raw application data.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.2" href="#section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  DTLS</span>

   DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6347" title="&quot;Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2&quot;">RFC6347</a>] [<a href="#ref-DTLS-1.3" title="&quot;The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">DTLS-1.3</a>] is
   based on TLS, but differs in that it is designed to run over
   unreliable datagram protocols like UDP instead of TCP.  DTLS modifies
   the protocol to make sure it can still provide equivalent security
   guarantees to TLS with the exception of order protection/non-
   replayability.  DTLS was designed to be as similar to TLS as
   possible, so this document assumes that all properties from TLS are
   carried over except where specified.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Application-Specific Security Protocols</span>

   The following protocols provide application-specific security by
   protecting application payloads used for specific use cases.  Unlike
   the protocols above, these are not intended for generic application
   use.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.1" href="#section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  Secure RTP</span>

   Secure RTP (SRTP) is a profile for RTP that provides confidentiality,
   message authentication, and replay protection for RTP data packets
   and RTP control protocol (RTCP) packets [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3711" title="&quot;The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)&quot;">RFC3711</a>].  SRTP provides a
   record layer only, and requires a separate handshake protocol to
   provide key agreement and identity management.

   The commonly used handshake protocol for SRTP is DTLS, in the form of
   DTLS-SRTP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5764" title="&quot;Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Extension to Establish Keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)&quot;">RFC5764</a>].  This is an extension to DTLS that negotiates
   the use of SRTP as the record layer and describes how to export keys
   for use with SRTP.

   ZRTP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6189" title="&quot;ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP&quot;">RFC6189</a>] is an alternative key agreement and identity
   management protocol for SRTP.  ZRTP Key agreement is performed using
   a Diffie-Hellman key exchange that runs on the media path.  This
   generates a shared secret that is then used to generate the master
   key and salt for SRTP.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Transport-Layer Security Protocols</span>

   The following security protocols provide protection for both
   application payloads and headers that are used for Transport
   Services.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.1" href="#section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  IETF QUIC</span>

   QUIC is a new standards-track transport protocol that runs over UDP,
   loosely based on Google&#x27;s original proprietary gQUIC protocol
   [<a href="#ref-QUIC-TRANSPORT">QUIC-TRANSPORT</a>] (See <a href="#section-3.3.2">Section 3.3.2</a> for more details).  The QUIC
   transport layer itself provides support for data confidentiality and
   integrity.  This requires keys to be derived with a separate
   handshake protocol.  A mapping for QUIC of TLS 1.3 [<a href="#ref-QUIC-TLS" title="&quot;Using TLS to Secure QUIC&quot;">QUIC-TLS</a>] has
   been specified to provide this handshake.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.2" href="#section-3.3.2">3.3.2</a>.  Google QUIC</span>

   Google QUIC (gQUIC) is a UDP-based multiplexed streaming protocol
   designed and deployed by Google following experience from deploying
   SPDY, the proprietary predecessor to HTTP/2.  gQUIC was originally
   known as &quot;QUIC&quot;; this document uses gQUIC to unambiguously
   distinguish it from the standards-track IETF QUIC.  The proprietary
   technical forebear of IETF QUIC, gQUIC was originally designed with
   tightly integrated security and application data transport protocols.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.3" href="#section-3.3.3">3.3.3</a>.  tcpcrypt</span>

   Tcpcrypt [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8548" title="&quot;Cryptographic Protection of TCP Streams (tcpcrypt)&quot;">RFC8548</a>] is a lightweight extension to the TCP protocol for
   opportunistic encryption.  Applications may use tcpcrypt&#x27;s unique
   session ID for further application-level authentication.  Absent this
   authentication, tcpcrypt is vulnerable to active attacks.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.4" href="#section-3.3.4">3.3.4</a>.  MinimaLT</span>

   MinimaLT [<a href="#ref-MinimaLT" title="&quot;MinimaLT: minimal-latency networking through better security&quot;">MinimaLT</a>] is a UDP-based transport security protocol
   designed to offer confidentiality, mutual authentication, DoS
   prevention, and connection mobility.  One major goal of the protocol
   is to leverage existing protocols to obtain server-side configuration
   information used to more quickly bootstrap a connection.  MinimaLT
   uses a variant of TCP&#x27;s congestion control algorithm.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3.5" href="#section-3.3.5">3.3.5</a>.  CurveCP</span>

   CurveCP [<a href="#ref-CurveCP" title="&quot;CurveCP: Usable security for the Internet&quot;">CurveCP</a>] is a UDP-based transport security that, unlike many
   other security protocols, is based entirely upon public key
   algorithms.  CurveCP provides its own reliability for application
   data as part of its protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Packet Security Protocols</span>

   The following protocols provide protection for IP packets.  These are
   generally used as tunnels, such as for Virtual Private Networks
   (VPNs).  Often, applications will not interact directly with these
   protocols.  However, applications that implement tunnels will
   interact directly with these protocols.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4.1" href="#section-3.4.1">3.4.1</a>.  IPsec</span>

   IKEv2 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7296" title="&quot;Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)&quot;">RFC7296</a>] and ESP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4303" title="&quot;IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)&quot;">RFC4303</a>] together form the modern IPsec
   protocol suite that encrypts and authenticates IP packets, either for
   creating tunnels (tunnel-mode) or for direct transport connections
   (transport-mode).  This suite of protocols separates out the key
   generation protocol (IKEv2) from the transport encryption protocol
   (ESP).  Each protocol can be used independently, but this document
   considers them together, since that is the most common pattern.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4.2" href="#section-3.4.2">3.4.2</a>.  WireGuard</span>

   WireGuard [<a href="#ref-WireGuard">WireGuard</a>] is an IP-layer protocol designed as an
   alternative to IPsec for certain use cases.  It uses UDP to
   encapsulate IP datagrams between peers.  Unlike most transport
   security protocols, which rely on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for
   peer authentication, WireGuard authenticates peers using pre-shared
   public keys delivered out of band, each of which is bound to one or
   more IP addresses.  Moreover, as a protocol suited for VPNs,
   WireGuard offers no extensibility, negotiation, or cryptographic
   agility.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4.3" href="#section-3.4.3">3.4.3</a>.  OpenVPN</span>

   OpenVPN [<a href="#ref-OpenVPN" title="&quot;OpenVPN cryptographic layer&quot;">OpenVPN</a>] is a commonly used protocol designed as an
   alternative to IPsec.  A major goal of this protocol is to provide a
   VPN that is simple to configure and works over a variety of
   transports.  OpenVPN encapsulates either IP packets or Ethernet
   frames within a secure tunnel and can run over either UDP or TCP.
   For key establishment, OpenVPN can either use TLS as a handshake
   protocol or use pre-shared keys.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Transport Dependencies</span>

   Across the different security protocols listed above, the primary
   dependency on transport protocols is the presentation of data: either
   an unbounded stream of bytes, or framed messages.  Within protocols
   that rely on the transport for message framing, most are built to run
   over transports that inherently provide framing, like UDP, but some
   also define how their messages can be framed over byte-stream
   transports.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Reliable Byte-Stream Transports</span>

   The following protocols all depend upon running on a transport
   protocol that provides a reliable, in-order stream of bytes.  This is
   typically TCP.

   Application Payload Security Protocols:

   *  TLS

   Transport-Layer Security Protocols:

   *  tcpcrypt

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Unreliable Datagram Transports</span>

   The following protocols all depend on the transport protocol to
   provide message framing to encapsulate their data.  These protocols
   are built to run using UDP, and thus do not have any requirement for
   reliability.  Running these protocols over a protocol that does
   provide reliability will not break functionality but may lead to
   multiple layers of reliability if the security protocol is
   encapsulating other transport protocol traffic.

   Application Payload Security Protocols:

   *  DTLS

   *  ZRTP

   *  SRTP

   Transport-Layer Security Protocols:

   *  QUIC

   *  MinimaLT

   *  CurveCP

   Packet Security Protocols:

   *  IPsec

   *  WireGuard

   *  OpenVPN

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2.1" href="#section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Datagram Protocols with Defined Byte-Stream Mappings</span>

   Of the protocols listed above that depend on the transport for
   message framing, some do have well-defined mappings for sending their
   messages over byte-stream transports like TCP.

   Application Payload Security Protocols:

   *  DTLS when used as a handshake protocol for SRTP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7850" title="&quot;Registering Values of the SDP &#x27;proto&#x27; Field for Transporting RTP Media over TCP under Various RTP Profiles&quot;">RFC7850</a>]

   *  ZRTP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6189" title="&quot;ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP&quot;">RFC6189</a>]

   *  SRTP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4571" title="&quot;Framing Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Packets over Connection- Oriented Transport&quot;">RFC4571</a>][RFC3711]

   Packet Security Protocols:

   *  IPsec [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8229" title="&quot;TCP Encapsulation of IKE and IPsec Packets&quot;">RFC8229</a>]

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Transport-Specific Dependencies</span>

   One protocol surveyed, tcpcrypt, has a direct dependency on a feature
   in the transport that is needed for its functionality.  Specifically,
   tcpcrypt is designed to run on top of TCP and uses the TCP Encryption
   Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8547" title="&quot;TCP-ENO: Encryption Negotiation Option&quot;">RFC8547</a>] to negotiate its protocol
   support.

   QUIC, CurveCP, and MinimaLT provide both transport functionality and
   security functionality.  They depend on running over a framed
   protocol like UDP, but they add their own layers of reliability and
   other Transport Services.  Thus, an application that uses one of
   these protocols cannot decouple the security from transport
   functionality.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Application Interface</span>

   This section describes the interface exposed by the security
   protocols described above.  We partition these interfaces into pre-
   connection (configuration), connection, and post-connection
   interfaces, following conventions in [<a href="#ref-TAPS-INTERFACE">TAPS-INTERFACE</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-TAPS-ARCH">TAPS-ARCH</a>].

   Note that not all protocols support each interface.  The table in
   <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a> summarizes which protocol exposes which of the
   interfaces.  In the following sections, we provide abbreviations of
   the interface names to use in the summary table.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Pre-connection Interfaces</span>

   Configuration interfaces are used to configure the security protocols
   before a handshake begins or keys are negotiated.

   Identities and Private Keys (IPK):  The application can provide its
      identity, credentials (e.g., certificates), and private keys, or
      mechanisms to access these, to the security protocol to use during
      handshakes.

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  ZRTP

      *  QUIC

      *  MinimaLT

      *  CurveCP

      *  IPsec

      *  WireGuard

      *  OpenVPN

   Supported Algorithms (Key Exchange, Signatures, and Ciphersuites)
   (ALG):  The application can choose the algorithms that are supported
      for key exchange, signatures, and ciphersuites.

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  ZRTP

      *  QUIC

      *  tcpcrypt

      *  MinimaLT

      *  IPsec

      *  OpenVPN

   Extensions (EXT):  The application enables or configures extensions
      that are to be negotiated by the security protocol, such as
      Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7301" title="&quot;Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension&quot;">RFC7301</a>].

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  QUIC

   Session Cache Management (CM):  The application provides the ability
      to save and retrieve session state (such as tickets, keying
      material, and server parameters) that may be used to resume the
      security session.

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  ZRTP

      *  QUIC

      *  tcpcrypt

      *  MinimaLT

   Authentication Delegation (AD):  The application provides access to a
      separate module that will provide authentication, using the
      Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3748" title="&quot;Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)&quot;">RFC3748</a>] for example.

      *  IPsec

      *  tcpcrypt

   Pre-Shared Key Import (PSKI):  Either the handshake protocol or the
      application directly can supply pre-shared keys for use in
      encrypting (and authenticating) communication with a peer.

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  ZRTP

      *  QUIC

      *  tcpcrypt

      *  MinimaLT

      *  WireGuard

      *  OpenVPN

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Connection Interfaces</span>

   Identity Validation (IV):  During a handshake, the security protocol
      will conduct identity validation of the peer.  This can offload
      validation or occur transparently to the application.

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  ZRTP

      *  QUIC

      *  MinimaLT

      *  CurveCP

      *  IPsec

      *  WireGuard

      *  OpenVPN

   Source Address Validation (SAV):  The handshake protocol may interact
      with the transport protocol or application to validate the address
      of the remote peer that has sent data.  This involves sending a
      cookie exchange to avoid DoS attacks.  (This list omits protocols
      that depend on TCP and therefore implicitly perform SAV.)

      *  DTLS

      *  QUIC

      *  IPsec

      *  WireGuard

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Post-connection Interfaces</span>

   Connection Termination (CT):  The security protocol may be instructed
      to tear down its connection and session information.  This is
      needed by some protocols, e.g., to prevent application data
      truncation attacks in which an attacker terminates an underlying
      insecure connection-oriented protocol to terminate the session.

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  QUIC

      *  tcpcrypt

      *  MinimaLT

      *  IPsec

      *  OpenVPN

   Key Update (KU):  The handshake protocol may be instructed to update
      its keying material, either by the application directly or by the
      record protocol sending a key expiration event.

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  QUIC

      *  tcpcrypt

      *  MinimaLT

      an interface for producing shared secrets for application-specific
      uses.

      *  TLS

      *  DTLS

      *  tcpcrypt

      *  IPsec

      *  OpenVPN

      *  MinimaLT

   Key Expiration (KE):  The record protocol can signal that its keys
      are expiring due to reaching a time-based deadline or a use-based
      deadline (number of bytes that have been encrypted with the key).
      This interaction is often limited to signaling between the record
      layer and the handshake layer.

      *  IPsec

   Mobility Events (ME):  The record protocol can be signaled that it is
      being migrated to another transport or interface due to connection
      mobility, which may reset address and state validation and induce
      state changes such as use of a new Connection Identifier (CID).

      *  DTLS (version 1.3 only [<a href="#ref-DTLS-1.3" title="&quot;The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">DTLS-1.3</a>])

      *  QUIC

   This document has no IANA actions.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document summarizes existing transport security protocols and
   their interfaces.  It does not propose changes to or recommend usage
   of reference protocols.  Moreover, no claims of security and privacy
   properties beyond those guaranteed by the protocols discussed are
   made.  For example, metadata leakage via timing side channels and
   traffic analysis may compromise any protocol discussed in this
   survey.  Applications using Security Interfaces should take such
   limitations into consideration when using a particular protocol
   implementation.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Privacy Considerations</span>

   Analysis of how features improve or degrade privacy is intentionally
   omitted from this survey.  All security protocols surveyed generally
   improve privacy by using encryption to reduce information leakage.
   However, varying amounts of metadata remain in the clear across each
   protocol.  For example, client and server certificates are sent in
   cleartext in TLS 1.2 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5246" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2&quot;">RFC5246</a>], whereas they are encrypted in TLS 1.3
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8446" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3&quot;">RFC8446</a>].  A survey of privacy features, or lack thereof, for
   various security protocols could be addressed in a separate document.
