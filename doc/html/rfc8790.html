Abstract

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type and data model can be
   used to send collections of resources, such as batches of sensor data
   or configuration parameters.  The Constrained Application Protocol
   (CoAP) FETCH, PATCH, and iPATCH methods enable accessing and updating
   parts of a resource or multiple resources with one request.  This
   document defines new media types for the CoAP FETCH, PATCH, and
   iPATCH methods for resources represented using the SenML data model.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428" title="&quot;Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)&quot;">RFC8428</a>] and data
   model can be used to transmit collections of resources, such as
   batches of sensor data or configuration parameters.

   An example of a SenML collection is shown below:

   [
    {&quot;bn&quot;:&quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/&quot;, &quot;n&quot;:&quot;5850&quot;, &quot;vb&quot;:true},
    {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;5851&quot;, &quot;v&quot;:42},
    {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;5750&quot;, &quot;vs&quot;:&quot;Ceiling light&quot;}
   ]

   Here, three resources, &quot;3311/0/5850&quot;, &quot;3311/0/5851&quot;, and
   &quot;3311/0/5750&quot;, of a dimmable light smart object [<a href="#ref-IPSO" title="&quot;IPSO Light Control Smart Object&quot;">IPSO</a>] are
   represented using a single SenML Pack with three SenML Records.  All
   resources share the same base name &quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/&quot;; hence, full
   names for the resources are &quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/5850&quot;, etc.

   The CoAP [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>] FETCH, PATCH, and iPATCH methods [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8132" title="&quot;PATCH and FETCH Methods for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC8132</a>] enable
   accessing and updating parts of a resource or multiple resources with
   one request.

   This document defines two new media types, one using the JavaScript
   Object Notation (JSON) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>] and one using the Concise Binary
   Object Representation (CBOR) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>], which can be used with the
   CoAP FETCH, PATCH, and iPATCH methods for resources represented using
   the SenML data model (i.e., for both SenML and Sensor Streaming
   Measurement Lists (SenSML) data).  The rest of the document uses the
   term &quot;(i)PATCH&quot; when referring to both methods as the semantics of
   the new media types are the same for the CoAP PATCH and iPATCH
   methods.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed
   in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8132" title="&quot;PATCH and FETCH Methods for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC8132</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428" title="&quot;Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)&quot;">RFC8428</a>].  The following additional terms are used
   in this document:

   Fetch Record:  One set of parameters that is used to match SenML
      Record(s).

   Fetch Pack:  One or more Fetch Records in an array structure.

   Patch Record:  One set of parameters similar to Fetch Record but also
      containing instructions on how to change existing SenML Pack(s).

   Patch Pack:  One or more Patch Records in an array structure.

   Target Record:  A Record in a SenML Pack that matches the selection
      criteria of a Fetch or Patch Record and hence is a target for a
      Fetch or Patch operation.

   Target Pack:  A SenML Pack that is a target for a Fetch or Patch
      operation.

   (i)PATCH:  A term that refers to both CoAP &quot;PATCH&quot; and &quot;iPATCH&quot;
      methods when there is no difference in this specification as to
      which one is used.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Using FETCH and (i)PATCH with SenML</span>

   The FETCH/(i)PATCH media types for SenML are modeled as extensions to
   the SenML media type to enable reuse of existing SenML parsers and
   generators, in particular on constrained devices.  Unless mentioned
   otherwise, FETCH and PATCH Packs are constructed with the same rules
   and constraints as SenML Packs.

   The key differences from the SenML media type are allowing the use of
   a &quot;null&quot; value for removing Records with the (i)PATCH method and the
   lack of value fields in Fetch Records.  Also, the Fetch and Patch
   Records do not have a default time or base version when the fields
   are omitted.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  SenML FETCH</span>

   The FETCH method can be used to select and return a subset of
   Records, in sequence, of one or more SenML Packs.  The SenML Records
   are selected by giving a set of names that, when resolved, match
   resolved names in a Target SenML Pack.  The names for a Fetch Pack
   are given using the SenML &quot;name&quot; and/or &quot;base name&quot; fields.  The
   names are resolved by concatenating the base name with the name field
   as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428" title="&quot;Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)&quot;">RFC8428</a>].

   A Fetch Pack MUST contain at least one Fetch Record.  A Fetch Record
   MUST contain a name and/or base name field.

   For example, to select the resources &quot;5850&quot; and &quot;5851&quot; from the
   example in <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a>, the following Fetch Pack can be used:

   [
    {&quot;bn&quot;:&quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/&quot;, &quot;n&quot;:&quot;5850&quot;},
    {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;5851&quot;}
   ]

   The result of a FETCH request with the example above would be:

   [
    {&quot;bn&quot;:&quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/&quot;, &quot;n&quot;:&quot;5850&quot;, &quot;vb&quot;:true},
    {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;5851&quot;, &quot;v&quot;:42},
   ]

   The SenML time and unit fields can be used in a Fetch Record to
   further narrow the selection of matched SenML Records.  When no time
   or unit is given in a Fetch Record, all SenML Records with the given
   name are matched (i.e., unlike with SenML Records, the lack of time
   field in a Fetch Record does not imply a time value of zero).  When
   time is given in the Fetch Record, a Target Record is matched only
   when its resolved time value and name are equal to those of the Fetch
   Record.  Similarly, when unit is given, a Target Record is matched
   only when its resolved unit and name are equal to those of the Fetch
   Record.  If both the time and unit are given in the Fetch Record, a
   Target Record is matched only when both are equal to those of the
   Fetch Record.  Each Target Record MUST be included in the response at
   most once, even if multiple Fetch Records match with the same Target
   Record.

   For example, if the resource &quot;5850&quot; had multiple sensor readings
   (SenML Records) with different time values, the following Fetch Pack
   can be used to retrieve the Record with time &quot;1.276020091e+09&quot;:

   [
    {&quot;bn&quot;:&quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/&quot;, &quot;n&quot;:&quot;5850&quot;, &quot;t&quot;:1.276020091e+09}
   ]

   The resolved form of Records (<a href="/doc/html/rfc8428#section-4.6">Section&nbsp;4.6 of [RFC8428]</a>) is used when
   comparing the names, times, and units of the Target and Fetch Records
   to accommodate differences in the use of the base values.  In the
   resolved form, the SenML name in the example above becomes
   &quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/5850&quot;.  Since there is no base time in the Pack,
   the time in resolved form is equal to the time in the example.

   If no SenML Records match, an empty SenML Pack (i.e., array with no
   elements) is returned as a response.

   Fetch Records MUST NOT contain other fields than name, base name,
   time, base time, unit, and base unit.  Implementations MUST reject
   and generate an error for a Fetch Pack with other fields.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc8132#section-2.2">[RFC8132],
   Section&nbsp;2.2</a> provides guidance for FETCH request error handling, e.g.,
   using the 4.22 (Unprocessable Entity) CoAP error response code.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  SenML (i)PATCH</span>

   The (i)PATCH method can be used to change the fields of SenML
   Records, to add new Records, and to remove existing Records.  The
   names, times, and units of the Patch Records are given and matched in
   the same way as for the Fetch Records, except each Patch Record MUST
   match at most one Target Record.  A Patch Record matching more than
   one Target Record is considered invalid (patching multiple Target
   Records with one Patch Record would result in multiple copies of the
   same Record).  Patch Packs can also include new values and other
   SenML fields for the Records.  Application of Patch Packs is
   idempotent; hence, the PATCH and iPATCH methods for SenML Packs are
   equivalent.

   When the name in a Patch Record matches with the name in an existing
   Record, the resolved time values and units (if any) are compared.  If
   the time values and units either do not exist in both Records or are
   equal, the Target Record is replaced with the contents of the Patch
   Record.  All Patch Records MUST contain at least a SenML Value or Sum
   field.

   If a Patch Record contains a name, or the combination of a time
   value, unit, and name, that does not exist in any existing Record in
   the Pack, the given Record, with all the fields it contains, is added
   to the Pack.

   If a Patch Record has a value (&quot;v&quot;) field with a null value, it MUST
   NOT be added, but the matched Record (if any) is removed from the
   Target Pack.

   The Patch Records MUST be applied in the same sequence as they are in
   the Patch Pack.  If multiple Patch Packs are being processed at the
   same time, the result MUST be equivalent to applying them in one
   sequence.

   Implementations MUST reject and generate an error for Patch Packs
   with invalid Records.  If a Patch Pack is rejected, the state of the
   Target Pack is not changed, i.e., either all or none of the Patch
   Records are applied.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc8132#section-3.4">[RFC8132], Section&nbsp;3.4</a> provides guidance for
   error handling with PATCH and iPATCH requests, e.g., using the 4.22
   (Unprocessable Entity) and 4.09 (Conflict) CoAP error response codes.

   For example, the following document could be given as an (i)PATCH
   payload to change/set the values of two SenML Records for the example
   in <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a>:

   [
    {&quot;bn&quot;:&quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/&quot;, &quot;n&quot;:&quot;5850&quot;, &quot;vb&quot;:false},
    {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;5851&quot;, &quot;v&quot;:10}
   ]

   If the request is successful, the resulting representation of the
   example SenML Pack would be as follows:

   [
    {&quot;bn&quot;:&quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/&quot;, &quot;n&quot;:&quot;5850&quot;, &quot;vb&quot;:false},
    {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;5851&quot;, &quot;v&quot;:10},
    {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;5750&quot;, &quot;vs&quot;:&quot;Ceiling light&quot;}
   ]

   As another example, the following document could be given as an
   (i)PATCH payload to remove the two SenML Records:

   [
    {&quot;bn&quot;:&quot;2001:db8::2/3311/0/&quot;, &quot;n&quot;:&quot;5850&quot;, &quot;v&quot;:null},
    {&quot;n&quot;:&quot;5851&quot;, &quot;v&quot;:null}
   ]

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Fragment Identification</span>

   Fragment identification for Records of Fetch and Patch Packs uses the
   same mechanism as SenML JSON/CBOR fragment identification (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8428#section-9">Section&nbsp;9 of [RFC8428]</a>), i.e., the &quot;rec&quot; scheme followed by a comma-
   separated list of Record positions or range(s) of Records.  For
   example, to select the 3rd and 5th Record of a Fetch or Patch Pack, a
   fragment identifier &quot;rec=3,5&quot; can be used in the URI of the Fetch or
   Patch Pack resource.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Extensibility</span>

   The SenML mandatory-to-understand field extensibility mechanism (see
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8428#section-4.4">Section&nbsp;4.4 of [RFC8428]</a>) does not apply to Patch Packs, i.e.,
   unknown fields MUST NOT generate an error, but such fields are
   treated like any other field (e.g., added to Patch target Records
   where applicable).

   This specification allows only a small subset of SenML fields in
   Fetch Records, but future specifications may enable new fields for
   Fetch Records and possibly also new fields for selecting targets for
   Patch Records.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security and privacy considerations of SenML also apply to the
   FETCH and (i)PATCH methods.  CoAP&#x27;s security mechanisms are used to
   provide security for the FETCH and (i)PATCH methods.

   In FETCH and (i)PATCH requests, the client can pass arbitrary names
   to the target resource for manipulation.  The resource implementer
   must take care to only allow access to names that are actually part
   of (or accessible through) the target resource.  In particular, the
   receiver needs to ensure that any input does not lead to uncontrolled
   special interpretation by the system.

   If the client is not allowed to do a GET or PUT on the full target
   resource (and thus all the names accessible through it), access
   control rules must be evaluated for each Record in the Pack.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   This document registers two new media types and CoAP Content-Format
   IDs for both media types.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  CoAP Content-Format Registration</span>

   IANA has assigned CoAP Content-Format IDs for the SenML PATCH and
   FETCH media types in the &quot;CoAP Content-Formats&quot; subregistry, within
   the &quot;Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters&quot; registry
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7252" title="&quot;The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)&quot;">RFC7252</a>].  The assigned IDs are shown in Table 1.

             +=============================+==========+=====+
             | Media Type                  | Encoding | ID  |

   The use of the FETCH and (i)PATCH methods with SenML was first
   introduced by the OMA SpecWorks Lightweight Machine to Machine
   (LwM2M) v1.1 specification.  This document generalizes the use to any
   SenML representation.  The authors would like to thank Carsten
   Bormann, Christian Amsüss, Jaime Jiménez, Klaus Hartke, Michael
   Richardson, and other participants from the IETF CoRE and OMA
   SpecWorks DMSE working groups who have contributed ideas and reviews.
