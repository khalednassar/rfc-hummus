 <span class="h1">Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-Power and Lossy Networks</span>

Abstract

   This document updates the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
   Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol defined in RFCs
   6775 and 8505.  The new extension is called Address-Protected
   Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND), and it protects the owner of an address
   against address theft and impersonation attacks in a Low-Power and
   Lossy Network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this extension compute a
   cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one or more of
   their Registered Addresses.  The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of
   the Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership
   of the Registered Addresses.  Once an address is registered with the
   Crypto-ID and a proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of
   that address can modify the registration information, thereby
   enforcing Source Address Validation.

   Neighbor Discovery optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks (aka 6LoWPAN
   ND) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6775" title="&quot;Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)&quot;">RFC6775</a>] adapts the original IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocols
   defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4861" title="&quot;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)&quot;">RFC4861</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4862" title="&quot;IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration&quot;">RFC4862</a>] for constrained Low-Power and
   Lossy Networks (LLNs).  In particular, 6LoWPAN ND introduces a
   unicast host Address Registration mechanism that reduces the use of
   multicast compared to the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) mechanism
   defined in IPv6 ND. 6LoWPAN ND defines a new Address Registration
   Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast Neighbor Solicitation
   (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages exchanged between a
   6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR).  It also defines the
   Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate Address Confirmation
   (DAC) messages between the 6LR and the 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR).
   In LLNs, the 6LBR is the central repository of all the Registered
   Addresses in its domain.

   The registration mechanism in &quot;Neighbor Discovery Optimization for
   IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)&quot;
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6775" title="&quot;Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)&quot;">RFC6775</a>] prevents the use of an address if that address is already
   registered in the subnet (first come, first served).  In order to
   validate address ownership, &quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over
   Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor
   Discovery&quot; [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>] defines a Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR)
   field.  [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>] enables a 6LR and 6LBR to validate the association
   between the Registered Address of a node and its ROVR.  The ROVR can
   be derived from the link-layer address of the device (using the
   64-bit Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64) address format specified
   by IEEE).  However, the EUI-64 can be spoofed; therefore, any node
   connected to the subnet and aware of a registered-address-to-ROVR
   mapping could effectively fake the ROVR.  This would allow an
   attacker to steal the address and redirect traffic for that address.
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>] defines an Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) that
   transports alternate forms of ROVRs and is a prerequisite for this
   specification.

   In this specification, a 6LN generates a cryptographic identifier
   (Crypto-ID) and places it in the ROVR field during the registration
   of one (or more) of its addresses with the 6LR(s).  Proof of
   ownership of the Crypto-ID is passed with the first registration
   exchange to a new 6LR and enforced at the 6LR.  The 6LR validates
   ownership of the Crypto-ID before it creates any new registration
   state or changes existing information.

   The protected address registration protocol proposed in this document
   provides the same conceptual benefit as Source Address Validation
   Improvement (SAVI) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7039" title="&quot;Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Framework&quot;">RFC7039</a>] in that only the owner of an IPv6
   address may source packets with that address.  As opposed to
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7039" title="&quot;Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Framework&quot;">RFC7039</a>], which relies on snooping protocols, the protection
   provided by this document is based on a state that is installed and
   maintained in the network by the owner of the address.  With this
   specification, a 6LN may use a 6LR for forwarding an IPv6 packet if
   and only if it has registered the address used as the source of the
   packet with that 6LR.

   With the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4944" title="&quot;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks&quot;">RFC4944</a>] and [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6282" title="&quot;Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4-Based Networks&quot;">RFC6282</a>], a 6LN
   can obtain better compression for an IPv6 address with an Interface
   ID (IID) that is derived from a Layer 2 (L2) address.  Such
   compression is incompatible with &quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND&quot;)
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>] and &quot;Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs)&quot;
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3972" title="&quot;Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA)&quot;">RFC3972</a>], since they derive the IID from cryptographic keys.  This
   specification, on the other hand, separates the IID generation from
   cryptographic computations and can enable better compression.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Updating <a href="/doc/html/rfc8505">RFC 8505</a></span>

   <a href="/doc/html/rfc8505#section-5.3">Section&nbsp;5.3 of [RFC8505]</a> introduces the ROVR that is used to detect
   and reject duplicate registrations in the DAD process.  The ROVR is a
   generic object that is designed for both backward compatibility and
   the capability to introduce new computation methods in the future.
   Using a Crypto-ID per this specification is the RECOMMENDED method.
   <a href="#section-7.5">Section 7.5</a> discusses collisions when heterogeneous methods to
   compute the ROVR field coexist inside a network.

   This specification introduces a new identifier called a Crypto-ID
   that is transported in the ROVR field and used to indirectly prove
   the ownership of an address that is being registered by means of
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>].  The Crypto-ID is derived from a cryptographic public key
   and additional parameters.

   The overall mechanism requires the support of Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography (ECC) and a hash function as detailed in <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>.
   To enable the verification of the proof, the Registering Node needs
   to supply certain parameters including a nonce and a signature that
   will demonstrate that the node possesses the private key
   corresponding to the public key used to build the Crypto-ID.

   The elliptic curves and the hash functions listed in Table 1 in
   <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a> can be used with this specification; more may be added in
   the future to the corresponding IANA registry.  The cryptographic
   algorithms used (including the curve and the representation
   conventions) are signaled by the Crypto-Type field in a new IPv6 ND
   Crypto-ID Parameters Option (CIPO) (see <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>) that contains
   the parameters that are necessary for address validation.  A new NDP
   Signature Option (<a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>) is also specified in this document to
   carry the resulting signature.  A Nonce Option [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>] is added in
   the NA(EARO) that is used to request the validation, and all three
   options are needed in the NS(EARO) that provides the validation.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  New Fields and Options</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  New Crypto-ID</span>

   The Crypto-ID is transported in the ROVR field of the EARO and the
   Extended Duplicate Address Request (EDAR) message and is associated
   with the Registered Address at the 6LR and the 6LBR.  The ownership
   of a Crypto-ID can be demonstrated by cryptographic mechanisms, and
   by association, the ownership of the Registered Address can be
   ascertained.

   A node in possession of the necessary cryptographic primitives SHOULD
   use Crypto-ID by default as ROVR in its registrations.  Whether a
   ROVR is a Crypto-ID is indicated by a new &quot;C&quot; flag in the EARO of the
   NS(EARO) message.

   The Crypto-ID is derived from the public key and a modifier as
   follows:

   1.  The hash function used internally by the signature scheme and
       indicated by the Crypto-Type (see Table 1 in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>) is
       applied to the CIPO.  Note that all the reserved and padding bits
       MUST be set to zero.

   2.  The leftmost bits of the resulting hash, up to the desired size,
       are used as the Crypto-ID.

   At the time of this writing, a minimal size for the Crypto-ID of 128
   bits is RECOMMENDED unless backward compatibility is needed [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>]
   (in which case it is at least 64 bits).  The size of the Crypto-ID is
   likely to increase in the future.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Crypto-ID Parameters Option</span>

   This specification defines the CIPO.  The CIPO carries the parameters
   used to form a Crypto-ID.

   In order to provide cryptographic agility [<a href="#ref-BCP201" title="&quot;Guidelines for Cryptographic Algorithm Agility and Selecting Mandatory-to-Implement Algorithms&quot;">BCP201</a>], this
   specification supports different elliptic-curve-based signature
   schemes, indicated by a Crypto-Type field:

   *  The ECDSA256 signature scheme, which uses ECDSA with the NIST
      P-256 curve [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>] and the hash function SHA-256 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6234" title="&quot;US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)&quot;">RFC6234</a>]
      internally, MUST be supported by all implementations.

   *  The Ed25519 signature scheme, which uses the Pure Edwards-Curve
      Digital Signature Algorithm (PureEdDSA) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8032" title="&quot;Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)&quot;">RFC8032</a>] with the twisted
      Edwards curve Edwards25519 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7748" title="&quot;Elliptic Curves for Security&quot;">RFC7748</a>] and the hash function SHA-512
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6234" title="&quot;US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)&quot;">RFC6234</a>] internally, MAY be supported as an alternative.

   *  The ECDSA25519 signature scheme, which uses ECDSA [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>] with
      the Weierstrass curve Wei25519 (see <a href="#appendix-B.4">Appendix B.4</a>) and the hash
      function SHA-256 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6234" title="&quot;US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)&quot;">RFC6234</a>] internally, MAY also be supported.

   This specification uses signature schemes that target similar
   cryptographic strength but rely on different curves, hash functions,
   signature algorithms, and/or representation conventions.  Future
   specification may extend this to different cryptographic algorithms
   and key sizes, e.g., to provide better security properties or a
   simpler implementation.

                   Figure 2: Crypto-ID Parameters Option

   Type:  8-bit unsigned integer.  IANA has assigned value 39; see
      Table 2.

   Length:  8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option in units
      of 8 octets.

   Reserved1:  5-bit unsigned integer.  It MUST be set to zero by the
      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Public Key Length:  11-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the
      Public Key field in bytes.  The actual length depends on the
      Crypto-Type value and how the public key is represented.  The
      valid values with this document are provided in Table 1.

   Crypto-Type:  8-bit unsigned integer.  The type of cryptographic
      algorithm used in calculation of the Crypto-ID indexed by IANA in
      the &quot;Crypto-Types&quot; subregistry in the &quot;Internet Control Message
      Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters&quot; registry (see
      <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>).

   Modifier:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Set to an arbitrary value by the
      creator of the Crypto-ID.  The role of the modifier is to enable
      the formation of multiple Crypto-IDs from the same key pair.  This
      reduces the traceability and, thus, improves the privacy of a
      constrained node without requiring many key pairs.

   EARO Length:  8-bit unsigned integer.  The option length of the EARO
      that contains the Crypto-ID associated with the CIPO.

   Public Key:  A variable-length field; the size is indicated in the
      Public Key Length field.

   Padding:  A variable-length field that completes the Public Key field
      to align to the next 8-byte boundary.  It MUST be set to zero by
      the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   The implementation of multiple hash functions in a constrained device
   may consume excessive amounts of program memory.  This specification
   enables the use of the same hash function SHA-256 [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6234" title="&quot;US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)&quot;">RFC6234</a>] for two
   of the three supported ECC-based signature schemes.  Some code
   factorization is also possible for the ECC computation itself.

   [<a id="ref-CURVE-REPR">CURVE-REPR</a>] provides information on how to represent Montgomery
   curves and (twisted) Edwards curves as curves in short-Weierstrass
   form, and it illustrates how this can be used to implement elliptic
   curve computations using existing implementations that already
   provide, e.g., ECDSA and ECDH using NIST [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>] prime curves.
   For more details on representation conventions, refer to <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  NDP Signature Option</span>

   This specification defines the NDP Signature Option (NDPSO).  The
   NDPSO carries the signature that proves the ownership of the Crypto-
   ID and validates the address being registered.  The format of the
   NDPSO is illustrated in Figure 3.

   As opposed to the RSA Signature Option (RSAO) defined in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>
   of SEND [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>], the NDPSO does not have a key hash field.
   Instead, the leftmost 128 bits of the ROVR field in the EARO are used
   as hash to retrieve the CIPO that contains the key material used for
   signature verification, left-padded if needed.

   Another difference is that the NDPSO signs a fixed set of fields as
   opposed to all options that appear prior to it in the ND message that
   bears the signature.  This allows a CIPO that the 6LR already
   received to be omitted, at the expense of the capability to add
   arbitrary options that would be signed with an RSAO.

   An ND message that carries an NDPSO MUST have one and only one EARO.
   The EARO MUST contain a Crypto-ID in the ROVR field, and the Crypto-
   ID MUST be associated with the key pair used for the digital
   signature in the NDPSO.

   The CIPO may be present in the same message as the NDPSO.  If it is
   not present, it can be found in an abstract table that was created by
   a previous message and indexed by the hash.

   New Option Field:

   A:  1-bit flag.  Set to indicate that AP-ND is globally activated in
      the network.

   The &quot;A&quot; flag is set by the 6LBR that serves the network and is
   propagated by the 6LRs.  It is typically turned on when all 6LRs are
   migrated to this specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Protocol Scope</span>

   The scope of the protocol specified here is a 6LoWPAN LLN, typically
   a stub network connected to a larger IP network via a border router
   called a 6LBR per [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6775" title="&quot;Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)&quot;">RFC6775</a>].  A 6LBR has sufficient capability to
   satisfy the needs of DAD.

   The 6LBR maintains registration state for all devices in its attached
   LLN.  Together with the first-hop router (the 6LR), the 6LBR assures
   uniqueness and grants ownership of an IPv6 address before it can be
   used in the LLN.  This is in contrast to a traditional network that
   relies on IPv6 address autoconfiguration [<a href="/doc/html/rfc4862" title="&quot;IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration&quot;">RFC4862</a>], where there is no
   guarantee of ownership from the network, and each IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery packet must be individually secured [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>].

   In a mesh network, the 6LR is directly connected to the host device.
   This specification mandates that the peer-wise L2 security is
   deployed so that all the packets from a particular host are
   protected.  The 6LR may be multiple hops away from the 6LBR.  Packets
   are routed between the 6LR and the 6LBR via other 6LRs.

   This specification mandates that all the LLN links between the 6LR
   and the 6LBR are protected so that a packet that was validated by the
   first 6LR can be safely routed by other on-path 6LRs to the 6LBR.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Protocol Flows</span>

   The 6LR/6LBR ensures first come, first served by storing the ROVR
   associated to the address being registered upon the first
   registration and rejecting a registration with a different ROVR
   value.  A 6LN can claim any address as long as it is the first to
   make that claim.  After a successful registration, the 6LN becomes
   the owner of the Registered Address, and the address is bound to the
   ROVR value in the 6LR/6LBR registry.

   This specification protects the ownership of the address at the first
   hop (the edge).  Its use in a network is signaled by the &quot;A&quot; flag in
   the 6CIO.  The flag is set by the 6LBR and propagated unchanged by
   the 6LRs.  Once every node in the network is upgraded to support this
   specification, the &quot;A&quot; flag can be set to turn the protection on
   globally.

   The 6LN places a cryptographic identifier, the Crypto-ID, in the ROVR
   that is associated with the address at the first registration,
   enabling the 6LR to later challenge it to verify that it is the
   original Registering Node.  The challenge may happen at any time at
   the discretion of the 6LR and the 6LBR.  A valid registration in the
   6LR or the 6LBR MUST NOT be altered until the challenge is complete.

   When the &quot;A&quot; flag in a subnet is set, the 6LR MUST challenge the 6LN
   before it creates a Binding with the &quot;C&quot; flag set in the EARO.  The
   6LR MUST also challenge the 6LN when a new registration attempts to
   change a parameter of an already validated Binding for that 6LN, for
   instance, its Source link-layer address.  Such verification protects
   against an attacker that attempts to steal the address of an honest
   node.

   The 6LR MUST indicate to the 6LBR that it performed a successful
   validation by setting a status code of 5 (&quot;Validation Requested&quot;) in
   the EDAR.  Upon a subsequent EDAR from a new 6LR with a status code
   that is not 5 for a validated Binding, the 6LBR MUST indicate to the
   new 6LR that it needs to challenge the 6LN using a status code of 5
   in the Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation (EDAC).

   The 6LR MUST challenge the 6LN when the 6LBR signals to do so, which
   is done with an EDAC message with a status code of 5.  The EDAC is
   echoed by the 6LR in the NA(EARO) back to the Registering Node.  The
   6LR SHOULD also challenge all its attached 6LNs at the time the 6LBR
   turns the &quot;A&quot; flag on in the 6CIO in orders to detect an issue
   immediately.

   If the 6LR does not support the Crypto-Type, it MUST reply with an
   EARO status code of 10 &quot;Validation Failed&quot; without a challenge.  In
   that case, the 6LN may try another Crypto-Type until it falls back to
   Crypto-Type 0, which MUST be supported by all 6LRs.

   A node may use more than one IPv6 address at the same time.  The
   separation of the address and the cryptographic material avoids the
   need for the constrained device to compute multiple keys for multiple
   addresses.  The 6LN MAY use the same Crypto-ID to prove the ownership
   of multiple IPv6 addresses.  The 6LN MAY also derive multiple Crypto-
   IDs from the same key pair by changing the modifier.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  First Exchange with a 6LR</span>

   A 6LN registers to a 6LR that is one hop away from it with the &quot;C&quot;
   flag set in the EARO, indicating that the ROVR field contains a
   Crypto-ID.  The Target Address in the NS message indicates the IPv6
   address that the 6LN is trying to register [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>].  The on-link
   (local) protocol interactions are shown in Figure 6.  If the 6LR does
   not have a state with the 6LN that is consistent with the NS(EARO),
   then it replies with a challenge NA(EARO, status=Validation
   Requested) that contains a Nonce Option (shown as NonceLR in
   Figure 6).

                    Figure 6: On-Link Protocol Operation

   The Nonce Option contains a nonce value that, to the extent possible
   for the implementation, was never used before.  This specification
   inherits the idea from [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>] that the nonce is a random value.
   Ideally, an implementation uses an unpredictable cryptographically
   random value [<a href="#ref-BCP106" title="&quot;Randomness Requirements for Security&quot;">BCP106</a>].  But that may be impractical in some LLN
   scenarios with resource-constrained devices.

   Alternatively, the device may use an always-incrementing value saved
   in the same stable storage as the key, so they are lost together, and
   start at a best-effort random value as either the nonce value or a
   component to its computation.

   The 6LN replies to the challenge with an NS(EARO) that includes the
   Nonce Option (shown as NonceLN in Figure 6), the CIPO (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>),
   and the NDPSO containing the signature.  Both nonces are included in
   the signed material.  This provides a &quot;contributory behavior&quot; that
   results in better security even when the nonces of one party are not
   generated as specified.

   The 6LR MUST store the information associated with a Crypto-ID on the
   first NS exchange where it appears in a fashion that the CIPO
   parameters can be retrieved from the Crypto-ID alone.

   The steps for the registration to the 6LR are as follows:

   Upon the first exchange with a 6LR, a 6LN will be challenged to prove
   ownership of the Crypto-ID and the Target Address being registered in
   the Neighbor Solicitation message.  When a 6LR receives an NS(EARO)
   registration with a new Crypto-ID as a ROVR, and unless the
   registration is rejected for another reason, it MUST challenge by
   responding with an NA(EARO) with a status code of &quot;Validation
   Requested&quot;.

   Upon receiving a first NA(EARO) with a status code of &quot;Validation
   Requested&quot; from a 6LR, the Registering Node SHOULD retry its
   registration with a CIPO (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>) that contains all the
   necessary material for building the Crypto-ID, the NonceLN that it
   generated, and the NDP Signature Option (<a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>) that proves its
   ownership of the Crypto-ID and intent of registering the Target
   Address.  In subsequent revalidation with the same 6LR, the 6LN MAY
   try to omit the CIPO to save bandwidth, with the expectation that the
   6LR saved it.  If the validation fails and it gets challenged again,
   then it SHOULD add the CIPO again.

   In order to validate the ownership, the 6LR performs the same steps
   as the 6LN and rebuilds the Crypto-ID based on the parameters in the
   CIPO.  If the rebuilt Crypto-ID matches the ROVR, the 6LN also
   verifies the signature contained in the NDPSO.  At that point, if the
   signature in the NDPSO can be verified, then the validation succeeds.
   Otherwise, the validation fails.

   If the 6LR fails to validate the signed NS(EARO), it responds with a
   status code of &quot;Validation Failed&quot;.  After receiving an NA(EARO) with
   a status code of &quot;Validation Failed&quot;, the Registering Node SHOULD try
   an alternate Crypto-Type; even if Crypto-Type 0 fails, it may try to
   register a different address in the NS message.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  NDPSO Generation and Verification</span>

   The signature generated by the 6LN to provide proof of ownership of
   the private key is carried in the NDPSO.  It is generated by the 6LN
   in a fashion that depends on the Crypto-Type (see Table 1 in
   <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>) chosen by the 6LN as follows:

   *  Form the message to be signed, by concatenating the following
      byte-strings in the order listed:

      1.  The 128-bit Message Type tag [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3972" title="&quot;Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA)&quot;">RFC3972</a>] (in network byte
          order).  For this specification, the tag is given in
          <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.  (The tag value has been generated by the editor
          of this specification on &lt;<a href="https://www.random.org">https://www.random.org</a>&gt;.)

      2.  The CIPO.

      3.  The 16-byte Target Address (in network byte order) sent in the
          NS message.  It is the address that the 6LN is registering
          with the 6LR and 6LBR.

      4.  The NonceLR received from the 6LR (in network byte order) in
          the NA message.  The nonce is at least 6 bytes long as defined
          in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>].

      5.  The NonceLN sent from the 6LN (in network byte order).  The
          nonce is at least 6 bytes long as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>].

      6.  The 1-byte option length of the EARO containing the Crypto-ID.

   *  Apply the signature algorithm specified by the Crypto-Type using
      the private key.

   Upon receiving the NDPSO and CIPO options, the 6LR first checks that
   the EARO Length in the CIPO matches the length of the EARO.  If so,
   it regenerates the Crypto-ID based on the CIPO to make sure that the
   leftmost bits up to the size of the ROVR match.

   If, and only if, the check is successful, it tries to verify the
   signature in the NDPSO using the following steps:

   *  Form the message to be verified, by concatenating the following
      byte-strings in the order listed:

      1.  The 128-bit Message Type tag given in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a> (in network
          byte order).

      2.  The CIPO.

      3.  The 16-byte Target Address (in network byte order) received in
          the NS message.  It is the address that the 6LN is registering
          with the 6LR and 6LBR.

      4.  The NonceLR sent in the NA message.  The nonce is at least 6
          bytes long as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>].

      5.  The NonceLN received from the 6LN (in network byte order) in
          the NS message.  The nonce is at least 6 bytes long as defined
          in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>].

      6.  The 1-byte EARO Length received in the CIPO.

   *  Verify the signature on this message with the public key in the
      CIPO and the locally computed values using the signature algorithm
      specified by the Crypto-Type.  If the verification succeeds, the
      6LR propagates the information to the 6LBR using an EDAR/EDAC
      flow.

   *  Due to the first-come, first-served nature of the registration, if
      the address is not registered to the 6LBR, then flow succeeds and
      both the 6LR and 6LBR add the state information about the Crypto-
      ID and Target Address being registered to their respective
      abstract databases.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.3" href="#section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Multi-Hop Operation</span>

   A new 6LN that joins the network autoconfigures an address and
   performs an initial registration to a neighboring 6LR with an NS
   message that carries an EARO [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>].

   In a multi-hop 6LoWPAN, the registration with Crypto-ID is propagated
   to 6LBR as shown in Figure 7, which illustrates the registration flow
   all the way to a 6LoWPAN Backbone Router (6BBR) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8929" title="&quot;IPv6 Backbone Router&quot;">RFC8929</a>].

                      Figure 7: (Re-)Registration Flow

   The 6LR and the 6LBR communicate using ICMPv6 EDAR and EDAC messages
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>] as shown in Figure 7.  This specification extends EDAR/EDAC
   messages to carry cryptographically generated ROVR.

   The assumption is that the 6LR and the 6LBR maintain a security
   association to authenticate and protect the integrity of the EDAR and
   EDAC messages, so there is no need to propagate the proof of
   ownership to the 6LBR.  The 6LBR implicitly trusts that the 6LR
   performs the verification when the 6LBR requires it, and if there is
   no further exchange from the 6LR to remove the state, the
   verification succeeded.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Brown Field</span>

   Only 6LRs that are upgraded to this specification are capable of
   challenging a registration and avoiding an attack.  In a brown
   (mixed) network, an attacker may attach to a legacy 6LR and fool the
   6LBR.  So even if the &quot;A&quot; flag could be set at any time to test the
   protocol operation, the security will only be effective when all the
   6LRs are upgraded.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Threats Identified in <a href="/doc/html/rfc3971">RFC 3971</a></span>

   Observations regarding the following threats to the local network in
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>] also apply to this specification.

   Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement Spoofing:  Threats in
      <a href="/doc/html/rfc3971#section-9.2.1">Section&nbsp;9.2.1 of [RFC3971]</a> apply.  AP-ND counters the threats on
      NS(EARO) messages by requiring that the NDPSO and CIPO be present
      in these solicitations.

   Duplicate Address Detection DoS Attack:  Inside the LLN, duplicate
      addresses are sorted out using the ROVR.  A different ROVR for the
      same Registered Address entails a rejection of the second
      registration [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>].  DADs coming from the backbone network are
      not forwarded over the LLN to provide some protection against DoS
      attacks inside the resource-constrained part of the network.
      However, the EARO is present in the NS/NA messages exchanged over
      the backbone network.  This protects against misinterpreting node
      movement as a duplication and enables the Backbone Routers to
      determine which subnet has the most recent registration [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>]
      and is thus the best candidate to validate the registration
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8929" title="&quot;IPv6 Backbone Router&quot;">RFC8929</a>].

   Router Solicitation and Advertisement Attacks:  This specification
      does not change the protection of RS and RA, which can still be
      protected by SEND.

   Replay Attacks:  Nonces should never repeat but they do not need to
      be unpredictable for secure operation.  Using nonces (NonceLR and
      NonceLN) generated by both the 6LR and 6LN ensures a contributory
      behavior that provides an efficient protection against replay
      attacks of the challenge/response flow.  The quality of the
      protection by a random nonce depends on the random number
      generator.

   Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack:  A rogue node that can access the L2
      network may form many addresses and register them using AP-ND.
      The perimeter of the attack is all the 6LRs in range of the
      attacker.  The 6LR MUST protect itself against overflows and
      reject excessive registration with a status code of 2 &quot;Neighbor
      Cache Full&quot;.  This effectively blocks another (honest) 6LN from
      registering to the same 6LR, but the 6LN may register to other
      6LRs that are in its range but not in that of the attacker.

   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>] also apply here, in particular, denial-of-service (DoS)
   attacks against the registry at the 6LR or 6LBR.

   Secure ND [<a href="/doc/html/rfc3971" title="&quot;SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)&quot;">RFC3971</a>] forces the IPv6 address to be cryptographic since
   it integrates the CGA as the IID in the IPv6 address.  In contrast,
   this specification saves about 1 KB in every NS/NA message.  Also,
   this specification separates the cryptographic identifier from the
   registered IPv6 address so that a node can have more than one IPv6
   address protected by the same cryptographic identifier.

   With this specification, the 6LN can freely form its IPv6 address(es)
   in any fashion, thereby enabling either 6LoWPAN compression for IPv6
   addresses that are derived from L2 addresses or temporary addresses
   that cannot be compressed, e.g., formed pseudorandomly and released
   in relatively short cycles for privacy reasons [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8064" title="&quot;Recommendation on Stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers&quot;">RFC8064</a>][RFC8065].

   This specification provides added protection for addresses that are
   obtained following due procedure [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>] but does not constrain the
   way the addresses are formed or the number of addresses that are used
   in parallel by a same entity.  An attacker may still perform a DoS
   attack against the registry at the 6LR or 6LBR or attempt to deplete
   the pool of available addresses at L2 or L3.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.4" href="#section-7.4">7.4</a>.  Compromised 6LR</span>

   This specification distributes the challenge and its validation at
   the edge of the network, between the 6LN and its 6LR.  This protects
   against DoS attacks targeted at that central 6LBR.  This also saves
   back-and-forth exchanges across a potentially large and constrained
   network.

   The downside is that the 6LBR needs to trust the 6LR to perform the
   checking adequately, and the communication between the 6LR and the
   6LBR must be protected to avoid tampering with the result of the
   validation.

   If a 6LR is compromised, and provided that it knows the ROVR field
   used by the real owner of the address, the 6LR may pretend that the
   owner has moved, is now attached to it, and has successfully passed
   the Crypto-ID validation.  The 6LR may then attract and inject
   traffic at will on behalf of that address, or let an attacker take
   ownership of the address.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.5" href="#section-7.5">7.5</a>.  ROVR Collisions</span>

   A collision of ROVRs (i.e., the Crypto-ID in this specification) is
   possible, but it is a rare event.  Assuming that the hash used for
   calculating the Crypto-ID is a well-behaved cryptographic hash, and,
   thus, random collisions are the only ones possible, if n = 2^(k) is
   the maximum number of hash values (i.e., a k-bit hash) and p is the
   number of nodes, then (assuming one Crypto-ID per node) the formula 1
   - e^(-p^(2)/(2n)) provides an approximation of the probability that
   there is at least one collision (birthday paradox).

   If the Crypto-ID is 64 bits (the least possible size allowed), the
   chance of a collision is 0.01% for a network of 66 million nodes.
   Moreover, the collision is only relevant when this happens within one
   stub network (6LBR).  In the case of such a collision, an honest node
   might accidentally claim the Registered Address of another legitimate
   node (with the same Crypto-ID).  To prevent such rare events, it is
   RECOMMENDED that nodes do not derive the address being registered
   from the ROVR.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.6" href="#section-7.6">7.6</a>.  Implementation Attacks</span>

   The signature schemes referenced in this specification comply with
   NIST [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>] or Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) standards
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8032" title="&quot;Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)&quot;">RFC8032</a>] and offer strong algorithmic security at roughly a 128-bit
   security level.  These signature schemes use elliptic curves that
   either were specifically designed with exception-free and constant-
   time arithmetic in mind [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7748" title="&quot;Elliptic Curves for Security&quot;">RFC7748</a>] or have extensive implementation
   experience of resistance to timing attacks [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>].

   However, careless implementations of the signing operations could
   nevertheless leak information on private keys.  For example, there
   are micro-architectural side channel attacks that implementors should
   be aware of [<a href="#ref-breaking-ed25519">breaking-ed25519</a>].  Implementors should be particularly
   aware that a secure implementation of Ed25519 requires a protected
   implementation of the hash function SHA-512, whereas this is not
   required with implementations of the hash function SHA-256 used with
   ECDSA256 and ECDSA25519.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.7" href="#section-7.7">7.7</a>.  Cross-Algorithm and Cross-Protocol Attacks</span>

   The key pair used in this specification can be self-generated, and
   the public key does not need to be exchanged, e.g., through
   certificates, with a third party before it is used.

   New key pairs can be formed for new registrations if the node
   desires.  However, the same private key MUST NOT be reused with more
   than one instantiation of the signature scheme in this specification.
   Also, the same private key MUST NOT be used for anything other than
   computing NDPSO signatures per this specification.

   ECDSA shall be used strictly as specified in [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>].  In
   particular, each signing operation of ECDSA MUST use randomly
   generated ephemeral private keys and MUST NOT reuse the ephemeral
   private key k across signing operations.  This precludes the use of
   deterministic ECDSA without a random input for the determination of
   k, which is deemed dangerous for the intended applications this
   document aims to serve.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.8" href="#section-7.8">7.8</a>.  Public Key Validation</span>

   Public keys contained in the CIPO field (which are used for signature
   verification) shall be verified to be correctly formed, by checking
   that this public key is indeed a point of the elliptic curve
   indicated by the Crypto-Type and that this point does have the proper
   order.

   For points used with the signature scheme Ed25519, one MUST check
   that this point is not in the small subgroup (see <a href="#appendix-B.1">Appendix B.1</a> of
   [<a href="#ref-CURVE-REPR">CURVE-REPR</a>]); for points used with the signature scheme ECDSA (i.e.,
   both ECDSA256 and ECDSA25519), one MUST check that the point has the
   same order as the base point of the curve in question.  This is
   commonly called &quot;full public key validation&quot; (again, see <a href="#appendix-B.1">Appendix B.1</a>
   of [<a href="#ref-CURVE-REPR">CURVE-REPR</a>]).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.9" href="#section-7.9">7.9</a>.  Correlating Registrations</span>

   The ROVR field in the EARO introduced in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8505" title="&quot;Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery&quot;">RFC8505</a>] extends the EUI-64
   field of the ARO defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6775" title="&quot;Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)&quot;">RFC6775</a>].  One of the drawbacks of using
   an EUI-64 as ROVR is that an attacker that is aware of the
   registrations can correlate traffic for the same 6LN across multiple
   addresses.  <a href="/doc/html/rfc8505#section-3">Section&nbsp;3 of [RFC8505]</a> indicates that the ROVR and the
   address being registered are decoupled.  A 6LN may use the same ROVR
   for multiple registrations or a different ROVR per registration, and
   the IID must not be derived from the ROVR.  In theory, different 6LNs
   could use the same ROVR as long as they do not attempt to register
   the same address.

   The modifier used in the computation of the Crypto-ID enables a 6LN
   to build different Crypto-IDs for different addresses with the same
   key pair.  Using that facility improves the privacy of the 6LN at the
   expense of storage in the 6LR, which will need to store multiple
   CIPOs that contain the same public key.  Note that if an attacker
   gains access to the 6LR, then the modifier alone does not provide
   protection, and the 6LN would need to generate different key pairs
   and link-layer addresses in an attempt to obfuscate its multiple
   ownership.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Requirements Addressed in This Document</span>

   In this section, the requirements of a secure Neighbor Discovery
   protocol for LLNs are stated.

   *  The protocol MUST be based on the Neighbor Discovery Optimization
      for the LLN protocol defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6775" title="&quot;Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)&quot;">RFC6775</a>].  <a href="/doc/html/rfc6775">RFC 6775</a> utilizes
      optimizations such as host-initiated interactions for sleeping
      resource-constrained hosts and the elimination of multicast
      address resolution.

   *  New options to be added to Neighbor Solicitation messages MUST
      lead to small packet sizes, especially compared with existing
      protocols such as SEND.  Smaller packet sizes facilitate low-power
      transmission by resource-constrained nodes on lossy links.

   *  The registration mechanism SHOULD be extensible to other LLN links
      and not be limited to IEEE 802.15.4 only.  LLN links for which a
      6lo &quot;IPv6 over foo&quot; specification exist, as well as low-power Wi-
      Fi, SHOULD be supported.

   *  As part of this protocol, a mechanism to compute a unique
      identifier should be provided with the capability to form a Link
      Local Address that SHOULD be unique at least within the LLN
      connected to a 6LBR.

   *  The Address Registration Option used in the ND registration SHOULD
      be extended to carry the relevant forms of the unique identifier.

   *  The Neighbor Discovery should specify the formation of a site-
      local address that follows the security recommendations from
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7217" title="&quot;A Method for Generating Semantically Opaque Interface Identifiers with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)&quot;">RFC7217</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.1" href="#appendix-B.1">B.1</a>.  Signature Schemes</span>

   The signature scheme ECDSA256 corresponding to Crypto-Type 0 is
   ECDSA, as specified in [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>], instantiated with the NIST prime
   curve P-256, as specified in <a href="#appendix-D.1.2">Appendix D.1.2</a> of [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>], and the
   hash function SHA-256, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6234" title="&quot;US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)&quot;">RFC6234</a>], where points of
   this NIST curve are represented as points of a short-Weierstrass
   curve (see [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>]) and are encoded as octet strings in most-
   significant-bit first (msb) and most-significant-byte first (MSB)
   order.  The signature itself consists of two integers (r and s),
   which are each encoded as fixed-size octet strings in MSB and msb
   order.  For further details, see [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>] for ECDSA, see
   <a href="#appendix-B.3">Appendix B.3</a> for the encoding of public keys, and see <a href="#appendix-B.2">Appendix B.2</a>
   for signature encoding.

   The signature scheme Ed25519 corresponding to Crypto-Type 1 is EdDSA,
   as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8032" title="&quot;Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)&quot;">RFC8032</a>], instantiated with the Montgomery curve
   Curve25519, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7748" title="&quot;Elliptic Curves for Security&quot;">RFC7748</a>], and the hash function SHA-512,
   as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6234" title="&quot;US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)&quot;">RFC6234</a>], where points of this Montgomery curve are
   represented as points of the corresponding twisted Edwards curve
   Edwards25519 (see <a href="#appendix-B.4">Appendix B.4</a>) and are encoded as octet strings in
   least-significant-bit first (lsb) and least-significant-byte first
   (LSB) order.  The signature itself consists of a bit string that
   encodes a point of this twisted Edwards curve, in compressed format,
   and an integer encoded in LSB and lsb order.  For details on EdDSA
   and the encoding of public keys and signatures, see the specification
   of pure Ed25519 in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8032" title="&quot;Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)&quot;">RFC8032</a>].

   The signature scheme ECDSA25519 corresponding to Crypto-Type 2 is
   ECDSA, as specified in [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>], instantiated with the Montgomery
   curve Curve25519, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7748" title="&quot;Elliptic Curves for Security&quot;">RFC7748</a>], and the hash function
   SHA-256, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6234" title="&quot;US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)&quot;">RFC6234</a>], where points of this Montgomery
   curve are represented as points of the corresponding short-
   Weierstrass curve Wei25519 (see <a href="#appendix-B.4">Appendix B.4</a>) and are encoded as
   octet strings in MSB and msb order.  The signature itself consists of
   a bit string that encodes two integers (r and s), which are each
   encoded as fixed-size octet strings in MSB and msb order.  For
   further details, see [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>] for ECDSA, see <a href="#appendix-B.3">Appendix B.3</a> for the
   encoding of public keys, and see <a href="#appendix-B.2">Appendix B.2</a> for signature encoding.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.2" href="#appendix-B.2">B.2</a>.  Representation of ECDSA Signatures</span>

   With ECDSA, each signature is an ordered pair (r, s) of integers
   [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>], where each integer is represented as a 32-octet string
   according to the FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion rules in
   [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title="&quot;SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography&quot;">SEC1</a>] and where the ordered pair of integers is represented as the
   right concatenation of these representation values (thereby resulting
   in a 64-octet string).  The inverse operation checks that the
   signature is a 64-octet string and represents the left-side and
   right-side halves of this string (each a 32-octet string) as the
   integers r and s, respectively, using the OctetString-to-FieldElement
   conversion rules in [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title="&quot;SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography&quot;">SEC1</a>].  In both cases, the field with these
   conversion rules is the set of integers modulo n, where n is the
   (prime) order of the base point of the curve in question.  (For
   elliptic curve nomenclature, see <a href="#appendix-B.1">Appendix B.1</a> of [<a href="#ref-CURVE-REPR">CURVE-REPR</a>].)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.3" href="#appendix-B.3">B.3</a>.  Representation of Public Keys Used with ECDSA</span>

   ECDSA is specified to be used with elliptic curves in short-
   Weierstrass form.  Each point of such a curve is represented as an
   octet string using the Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String
   conversion rules in [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title="&quot;SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography&quot;">SEC1</a>], where point compression may be enabled
   (which is indicated by the leftmost octet of this representation).
   The inverse operation converts an octet string to a point of this
   curve using the Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point conversion rules
   in [<a href="#ref-SEC1" title="&quot;SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography&quot;">SEC1</a>], whereby the point is rejected if this is the so-called
   point at infinity.  (This is the case if the input to this inverse
   operation is an octet string of length 1.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B.4" href="#appendix-B.4">B.4</a>.  Alternative Representations of Curve25519</span>

   The elliptic curve Curve25519, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7748" title="&quot;Elliptic Curves for Security&quot;">RFC7748</a>], is a so-
   called Montgomery curve.  Each point of this curve can also be
   represented as a point of a twisted Edwards curve or as a point of an
   elliptic curve in short-Weierstrass form, via a coordinate
   transformation (a so-called isomorphic mapping).  The parameters of
   the Montgomery curve and the corresponding isomorphic curves in
   twisted Edwards curve and short-Weierstrass form are as indicated
   below.  Here, the domain parameters of the Montgomery curve
   Curve25519 and of the twisted Edwards curve Edwards25519 are as
   specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7748" title="&quot;Elliptic Curves for Security&quot;">RFC7748</a>]; the domain parameters of the elliptic curve
   Wei25519 in short-Weierstrass form comply with Section 6.1.1 of
   [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-4">FIPS186-4</a>].  For further details on these curves and on the
   coordinate transformations referenced above, see [<a href="#ref-CURVE-REPR">CURVE-REPR</a>].
