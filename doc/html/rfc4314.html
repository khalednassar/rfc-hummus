<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction and Overview</span>

   The ACL (Access Control List) extension of the Internet Message
   Access Protocol [<a href="#ref-IMAP4">IMAP4</a>] permits mailbox access control lists to be
   retrieved and manipulated through the IMAP protocol.

   This document is a revision of <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC2086</a>].  It tries to
   clarify different ambiguities in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a>, in particular, the use of
   UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-UTF-8">UTF-8</a>] in access identifiers, which rights are required for
   different IMAP4 commands, and how READ-WRITE/READ-ONLY response codes
   are related to ACL.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   In examples, &quot;C:&quot; and &quot;S:&quot; indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   In all examples &quot;/&quot; character is used as hierarchy separator.

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS">KEYWORDS</a>].

   The phrase &quot;ACL server&quot; is just a shortcut for saying &quot;IMAP server
   that supports ACL extension as defined in this document&quot;.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Access Control</span>

   The ACL extension is present in any IMAP4 implementation that returns
   &quot;ACL&quot; as one of the supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY command.

   A server implementation conformant to this document MUST also return
   rights (see below) not defined in <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a> in the &quot;RIGHTS=&quot;
   capability.

   An access control list is a set of &lt;access identifier,rights&gt; pairs.
   An ACL applies to a mailbox name.

   Access identifier (or just &quot;identifier&quot;) is a UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-UTF-8">UTF-8</a>] string.
   The identifier &quot;anyone&quot; is reserved to refer to the universal
   identity (all authentications, including anonymous).  All user name
   strings accepted by the LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE commands to
   authenticate to the IMAP server are reserved as identifiers for the
   corresponding users.  Identifiers starting with a dash (&quot;-&quot;) are
   reserved for &quot;negative rights&quot;, described below.  All other
   identifier strings are interpreted in an implementation-defined
   manner.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc4314">RFC 4314</a>                        IMAP ACL                   December 2005</span>


   Rights is a string listing a (possibly empty) set of alphanumeric
   characters, each character listing a set of operations that is being
   controlled.  Lowercase letters are reserved for &quot;standard&quot; rights,
   listed in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>.  (Note that for compatibility with deployed
   clients and servers uppercase rights are not allowed.)  The set of
   standard rights can only be extended by a standards-track document.
   Digits are reserved for implementation- or site-defined rights.

   An implementation MAY tie rights together or MAY force rights to
   always or never be granted to particular identifiers.  For example,
   in an implementation that uses UNIX mode bits, the rights &quot;swite&quot; are
   tied, the &quot;a&quot; right is always granted to the owner of a mailbox and
   is never granted to another user.  If rights are tied in an
   implementation, the implementation must be conservative in granting
   rights in response to SETACL commands--unless all rights in a tied
   set are specified, none of that set should be included in the ACL
   entry for that identifier.  A client can discover the set of rights
   that may be granted to a given identifier in the ACL for a given
   mailbox name by using the LISTRIGHTS command.

   It is possible for multiple identifiers in an access control list to
   apply to a given user.  For example, an ACL may include rights to be
   granted to the identifier matching the user, one or more
   implementation-defined identifiers matching groups that include the
   user, and/or the identifier &quot;anyone&quot;.  How these rights are combined
   to determine the user&#x27;s access is implementation defined.  An
   implementation may choose, for example, to use the union of the
   rights granted to the applicable identifiers.  An implementation may
   instead choose, for example, to use only those rights granted to the
   most specific identifier present in the ACL.  A client can determine
   the set of rights granted to the logged-in user for a given mailbox
   name by using the MYRIGHTS command.

   When an identifier in an ACL starts with a dash (&quot;-&quot;), that indicates
   that associated rights are to be removed from the identifier prefixed
   by the dash.  This is referred to as a &quot;negative right&quot;.  This
   differs from DELETEACL in that a negative right is added to the ACL
   and is a part of the calculation of the rights.

   Let&#x27;s assume that an identifier &quot;fred&quot; refers to a user with login
   &quot;fred&quot;.  If the identifier &quot;-fred&quot; is granted the &quot;w&quot; right, that
   indicates that the &quot;w&quot; right is to be removed from users matching the
   identifier &quot;fred&quot;, even though the user &quot;fred&quot; might have the &quot;w&quot;
   right as a consequence of some other identifier in the ACL.  A
   DELETEACL of &quot;fred&quot; simply deletes the identifier &quot;fred&quot; from the
   ACL; it does not affect any rights that the user &quot;fred&quot; may get from
   another entry in the ACL, in particular it doesn&#x27;t affect rights
   granted to the identifier &quot;-fred&quot;.

   Server implementations are not required to support &quot;negative right&quot;
   identifiers.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Standard Rights</span>

   The currently defined standard rights are (note that the list below
   doesn&#x27;t list all commands that use a particular right):

   l - lookup (mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB commands, SUBSCRIBE
       mailbox)
   r - read (SELECT the mailbox, perform STATUS)
   s - keep seen/unseen information across sessions (set or clear
       \SEEN flag via STORE, also set \SEEN during APPEND/COPY/
       FETCH BODY[...])
   w - write (set or clear flags other than \SEEN and \DELETED via
       STORE, also set them during APPEND/COPY)
   i - insert (perform APPEND, COPY into mailbox)
   p - post (send mail to submission address for mailbox,
       not enforced by IMAP4 itself)
   k - create mailboxes (CREATE new sub-mailboxes in any
       implementation-defined hierarchy, parent mailbox for the new
       mailbox name in RENAME)
   x - delete mailbox (DELETE mailbox, old mailbox name in RENAME)
   t - delete messages (set or clear \DELETED flag via STORE, set
       \DELETED flag during APPEND/COPY)
   e - perform EXPUNGE and expunge as a part of CLOSE
   a - administer (perform SETACL/DELETEACL/GETACL/LISTRIGHTS)

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1.1" href="#section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>.  Obsolete Rights</span>

   Due to ambiguity in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a>, some existing <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a> server
   implementations use the &quot;c&quot; right to control the DELETE command.
   Others chose to use the &quot;d&quot; right to control the DELETE command.  For
   the former group, let&#x27;s define the &quot;create&quot; right as union of the &quot;k&quot;
   and &quot;x&quot; rights, and the &quot;delete&quot; right as union of the &quot;e&quot; and &quot;t&quot;
   rights.  For the latter group, let&#x27;s define the &quot;create&quot; rights as a
   synonym to the &quot;k&quot; right, and the &quot;delete&quot; right as union of the &quot;e&quot;,
   &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;x&quot; rights.

   For compatibility with <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a>, this section defines two virtual
   rights &quot;d&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.

   If a client includes the &quot;d&quot; right in a rights list, then it MUST be
   treated as if the client had included every member of the &quot;delete&quot;
   right.  (It is not an error for a client to specify both the &quot;d&quot;
   right and one or more members of the &quot;delete&quot; right, but the effect
   is no different than if just the &quot;d&quot; right or all members of the
   &quot;delete&quot; right had been specified.)

   When any of the &quot;delete&quot; member rights is set in a list of rights,
   the server MUST also include the &quot;d&quot; right when returning the list in
   a MYRIGHTS or ACL response.  This is to enable older clients
   conforming to <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a> to work with newer servers. (*)

   Example:    C: A001 SeTacl INBOX/Drafts David lrswida

   The client has specified the &quot;d&quot; right in the SETACL command above
   and it expands to &quot;et&quot; on the server:

               S: * ACL INBOX Fred rwipslxcetda David lrswideta
               S: A002 OK Getacl complete

   If the identifier specified in the LISTRIGHTS command can be granted
   any of the &quot;delete&quot; member rights on a mailbox, then the server MUST
   include the &quot;d&quot; right in the corresponding LISTRIGHTS response. (*)
   If the member rights aren&#x27;t tied to non-member rights, then the &quot;d&quot;
   right is returned by itself in the LISTRIGHTS response.  If any of
   the member rights needs to be tied to one (or more) non-member right,
   then the &quot;d&quot; right and all of the member rights need to be tied to
   the same non-member right(s) (**).

   If a client includes the &quot;c&quot; right in a rights list, then it MUST be
   treated as if the client had included every member of the &quot;create&quot;
   right.  (It is not an error for a client to specify both the &quot;c&quot;
   right and one or more members of the &quot;create&quot; right, but the effect

   The client has specified the &quot;d&quot; right in the SETACL command above
   and it expands to &quot;et&quot; on the server: As the client has specified the
   &quot;k&quot; right (which is a member of the &quot;c&quot; right), the server also
   returns the &quot;c&quot; right.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Access control management commands and responses</span>

   Servers, when processing a command that has an identifier as a
   parameter (i.e., any of SETACL, DELETEACL, and LISTRIGHTS commands),
   SHOULD first prepare the received identifier using &quot;SASLprep&quot; profile
   [<a href="#ref-SASLprep">SASLprep</a>] of the &quot;stringprep&quot; algorithm [<a href="#ref-Stringprep">Stringprep</a>].  If the
   preparation of the identifier fails or results in an empty string,

   minus, the following rights are removed from any existing rights for
   the identifier.  If the string does not start with a plus or minus,
   the rights replace any existing rights for the identifier.

   Note that an unrecognized right MUST cause the command to return the
   BAD response.  In particular, the server MUST NOT silently ignore
   unrecognized rights.

   Listing and subscribing/unsubscribing mailboxes:
      LIST - &quot;l&quot; right is required.  However, unlike other commands
      (e.g., SELECT) the server MUST NOT return a NO response if it
      can&#x27;t list a mailbox.
      Note that if the user has &quot;l&quot; right to a mailbox &quot;A/B&quot;, but not to
      its parent mailbox &quot;A&quot;, the LIST command should behave as if the
      mailbox &quot;A&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist, for example:

               C: A777 LIST &quot;&quot; *
               S: * LIST (\NoInferiors) &quot;/&quot; &quot;A/B&quot;
               S: * LIST () &quot;/&quot; &quot;C&quot;
               S: * LIST (\NoInferiors) &quot;/&quot; &quot;C/D&quot;
               S: A777 OK LIST completed


      SUBSCRIBE - &quot;l&quot; right is required only if the server checks for
      mailbox existence when performing SUBSCRIBE.

      UNSUBSCRIBE - no rights required to perform this operation.

      LSUB - &quot;l&quot; right is required only if the server checks for mailbox
      existence when performing SUBSCRIBE.  However, unlike other
      commands (e.g., SELECT) the server MUST NOT return a NO response
      if it can&#x27;t list a subscribed mailbox.

   Mailbox management:
      CREATE - &quot;k&quot; right on a nearest existing parent mailbox.  When a
      new mailbox is created, it SHOULD inherit the ACL from the parent
      mailbox (if one exists) in the defined hierarchy.

      DELETE - &quot;x&quot; right on the mailbox.  Note that some servers don&#x27;t
      allow to delete a non-empty mailbox.  If this is the case, the
      user would also need &quot;r&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;t&quot; rights, in order to open
      the mailbox and empty it.

      The DELETE command MUST delete the ACL associated with the deleted
      mailbox.

      RENAME - Moving a mailbox from one parent to another requires the
      &quot;x&quot; right on the mailbox itself and the &quot;k&quot; right for the new
      parent.  For example, if the user wants to rename the mailbox
      named &quot;A/B/C&quot; to &quot;D/E&quot;, the user must have the &quot;x&quot; right for the
      mailbox &quot;A/B/C&quot; and the &quot;k&quot; right for the mailbox &quot;D&quot;.
      The RENAME command SHOULD NOT change the ACLs on the renamed
      mailbox and submailboxes.

   Copying or appending messages:
      Before performing a COPY/APPEND command, the server MUST check if
      the user has &quot;i&quot; right for the target mailbox.  If the user
      doesn&#x27;t have &quot;i&quot; right, the operation fails.  Otherwise for each
      copied/appended message the server MUST check if the user has
         &quot;t&quot; right - when the message has \Deleted flag set
         &quot;s&quot; right - when the message has \Seen flag set
         &quot;w&quot; right - for all other message flags.
      Only when the user has a particular right are the corresponding
      flags stored for the newly created message.  The server MUST NOT
      fail a COPY/APPEND if the user has no rights to set a particular
      flag.

   Example:    C: A003 MYRIGHTS TargetMailbox
               S: * MYRIGHTS TargetMailbox rwis
               S: A003 OK Myrights complete

               C: A004 FETCH 1:3 (FLAGS)
               S: * 1 FETCH (FLAGS (\Draft \Deleted)
               S: * 2 FETCH (FLAGS (\Answered)
               S: * 3 FETCH (FLAGS ($Forwarded \Seen)
               S: A004 OK Fetch Completed

               C: A005 COPY 1:3 TargetMailbox
               S: A005 OK Copy completed

               C: A006 SELECT TargetMailbox
                  ...
               S: A006 Select Completed

      Let&#x27;s assume that the copied messages received message numbers
      77:79.

               C: A007 FETCH 77:79 (FLAGS)
               S: * 77 FETCH (FLAGS (\Draft))
               S: * 78 FETCH (FLAGS (\Answered))
               S: * 79 FETCH (FLAGS ($Forwarded \Seen))
               S: A007 OK Fetch Completed

      \Deleted flag was lost on COPY, as the user has no &quot;t&quot; right in
      the target mailbox.
      If the MYRIGHTS command with the tag A003 would have returned:

               S: * MYRIGHTS TargetMailbox rsti

      the response from the FETCH with the tag A007 would have been:

               C: A007 FETCH 77:79 (FLAGS)

               S: * 77 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted))
               S: * 78 FETCH (FLAGS ())
               S: * 79 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen))
               S: A007 OK Fetch Completed

      In the latter case, \Answered, $Forwarded, and \Draft flags were
      lost on COPY, as the user has no &quot;w&quot; right in the target mailbox.

   Expunging the selected mailbox:
      EXPUNGE - &quot;e&quot; right on the selected mailbox.

      CLOSE - &quot;e&quot; right on the selected mailbox.  If the server is
      unable to expunge the mailbox because the user doesn&#x27;t have the
      &quot;e&quot; right, the server MUST ignore the expunge request, close the
      mailbox, and return the tagged OK response.

   Fetch information about a mailbox and its messages:
      SELECT/EXAMINE/STATUS - &quot;r&quot; right on the mailbox.

      FETCH - A FETCH request that implies setting \Seen flag MUST NOT
      set it, if the current user doesn&#x27;t have &quot;s&quot; right.

   Changing flags:
      STORE - the server MUST check if the user has
         &quot;t&quot; right - when the user modifies \Deleted flag
         &quot;s&quot; right - when the user modifies \Seen flag
         &quot;w&quot; right - for all other message flags.
      STORE operation SHOULD NOT fail if the user has rights to modify
      at least one flag specified in the STORE, as the tagged NO
      response to a STORE command is not handled very well by deployed
      clients.

   Changing ACLs:
      SETACL/DELETEACL - &quot;a&quot; right on the mailbox.

   Reading ACLs:
      GETACL - &quot;a&quot; right on the mailbox.

      MYRIGHTS - any of the following rights is required to perform the
      operation: &quot;l&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;a&quot;.

      LISTRIGHTS - &quot;a&quot; right on the mailbox.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.1" href="#section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  Servers</span>

   This document defines an additional capability that is used to
   announce the list of extra rights (excluding the ones defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">2086</a>) supported by the server.  The set of rights MUST include &quot;t&quot;,
   &quot;e&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;k&quot;.  Note that the extra rights can appear in any
   order.

   Example:    C: 1 capability
               S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4REV1 STARTTLS LITERAL+
                  ACL RIGHTS=texk
               S: 1 OK completed

   Any server implementing an ACL extension MUST accurately reflect the
   current user&#x27;s rights in FLAGS and PERMANENTFLAGS responses.

   Example:    C: A142 SELECT INBOX
               S: * 172 EXISTS
               S: * 1 RECENT
               S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen
               S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid
               S: * OK [UIDNEXT 4392] Predicted next UID
               S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
               S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Seen \Answered \Flagged \*)] L
               S: A142 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed
               C: A143 MYRIGHTS INBOX
               S: * MYRIGHTS INBOX lrwis
               S: A143 OK completed

   Note that in order to get better performance the client MAY pipeline
   SELECT and MYRIGHTS commands:

               C: A142 SELECT INBOX
               C: A143 MYRIGHTS INBOX
               S: * 172 EXISTS

   Servers MAY cache the rights a user has on a mailbox when the mailbox
   is selected, so that if a client&#x27;s rights on a mailbox are changed
   with SETACL or DELETEACL, commands specific to the selected state
   (e.g., STORE, EXPUNGE) might not reflect the changed rights until the
   mailbox is re-selected.  If the server checks the rights on each
   command, then it SHOULD send FLAGS and PERMANENTFLAGS responses if
   they have changed.  If such server detects that the user no longer
   has read access to the mailbox, it MAY send an untagged BYE response
   and close connection.  It MAY also refuse to execute all commands
   specific to the selected state until the mailbox is closed; however,
   server implementors should note that most clients don&#x27;t handle NO
   responses very well.

   An ACL server MAY modify one or more ACLs for one or more identifiers
   as a side effect of modifying the ACL specified in a
   SETACL/DELETEACL.  If the server does that, it MUST send untagged ACL
   response(s) to notify the client about the changes made.

   An ACL server implementation MUST treat received ACL modification
   commands as a possible ambiguity with respect to subsequent commands
   affected by the ACL, as described in Section 5.5 of [<a href="#ref-IMAP4">IMAP4</a>].  Hence a
   pipeline SETACL + MYRIGHTS is an ambiguity with respect to the
   server, meaning that the server must execute the SETACL command to
   completion before the MYRIGHTS.  However, clients are permitted to
   send such a pipeline.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1.2" href="#section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>.  Clients</span>

   The following requirement is put on clients in order to allow for
   future extensibility.  A client implementation that allows a user to
   read and update ACLs MUST preserve unrecognized rights that it
   doesn&#x27;t allow the user to change.  That is, if the client

   1) can read ACLs
    and
   2) can update ACLs
    but
   3) doesn&#x27;t allow the user to change the rights the client doesn&#x27;t
   recognize, then it MUST preserve unrecognized rights.

   Otherwise the client could risk unintentionally removing permissions
   it doesn&#x27;t understand.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Mapping of ACL Rights to READ-WRITE and READ-ONLY Response Codes</span>

   A particular ACL server implementation MAY allow &quot;shared multiuser
   access&quot; to some mailboxes.  &quot;Shared multiuser access&quot; to a mailbox
   means that multiple different users are able to access the same
   mailbox, if they have proper access rights.  &quot;Shared multiuser
   access&quot; to the mailbox doesn&#x27;t mean that the ACL for the mailbox is
   currently set to allow access by multiple users.  Let&#x27;s denote a
   &quot;shared multiuser write access&quot; as a &quot;shared multiuser access&quot; when a
   user can be granted flag modification rights (any of &quot;w&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, or
   &quot;t&quot;).

   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> describes which rights are required for modifying different
   flags.

   If the ACL server implements some flags as shared for a mailbox
   (i.e., the ACL for the mailbox MAY be set up so that changes to those
   flags are visible to another user), let&#x27;s call the set of rights
   associated with these flags (as described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>) for that
   mailbox collectively as &quot;shared flag rights&quot;.  Note that the &quot;shared
   flag rights&quot; set MAY be different for different mailboxes.

   If the server doesn&#x27;t support &quot;shared multiuser write access&quot; to a
   mailbox or doesn&#x27;t implement shared flags on the mailbox, &quot;shared
   flag rights&quot; for the mailbox is defined to be the empty set.

   Example 1: Mailbox &quot;banan&quot; allows &quot;shared multiuser write access&quot; and
              implements flags \Deleted, \Answered, and $MDNSent as
              shared flags. &quot;Shared flag rights&quot; for the mailbox &quot;banan&quot;
              is a set containing flags &quot;t&quot; (because system flag
              \Deleted requires &quot;t&quot; right) and &quot;w&quot; (because both
              \Answered and $MDNSent require &quot;w&quot; right).

   Example 2: Mailbox &quot;apple&quot; allows &quot;shared multiuser write access&quot; and
              implements \Seen system flag as shared flag. &quot;Shared flag
              rights&quot; for the mailbox &quot;apple&quot; contains &quot;s&quot; right
              because system flag \Seen requires &quot;s&quot; right.

   Example 3: Mailbox &quot;pear&quot; allows &quot;shared multiuser write access&quot; and
              implements flags \Seen, \Draft as shared flags. &quot;Shared
              flag rights&quot; for the mailbox &quot;apple&quot; is a set containing
              flags &quot;s&quot; (because system flag \Seen requires &quot;s&quot; right)
              and &quot;w&quot; (because system flag \Draft requires &quot;w&quot; right).

   The server MUST include a READ-ONLY response code in the tagged OK
   response to a SELECT command if none of the following rights is
   granted to the current user:

    &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;shared flag rights&quot;(***).

   The server SHOULD include a READ-WRITE response code in the tagged OK
   response if at least one of the &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, or &quot;shared flag
   rights&quot;(***) is granted to the current user.

   (***) Note that a future extension to this document can extend the
   list of rights that causes the server to return the READ-WRITE
   response code.

   Example 1 (continued): The user that has &quot;lrs&quot; rights for the mailbox
                          &quot;banan&quot;.  The server returns READ-ONLY
                          response code on SELECT, as none of &quot;iewt&quot;
                          rights is granted to the user.

   Example 2 (continued): The user that has &quot;rit&quot; rights for the mailbox
                          &quot;apple&quot;.  The server returns READ-WRITE
                          response code on SELECT, as the user has &quot;i&quot;
                          right.

   Example 3 (continued): The user that has &quot;rset&quot; rights for the
                          mailbox &quot;pear&quot;.  The server returns READ-WRITE
                          response code on SELECT, as the user has &quot;e&quot;
                          and &quot;s&quot; rights.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   An implementation MUST make sure the ACL commands themselves do not
   give information about mailboxes with appropriately restricted ACLs.
   For example, when a user agent executes a GETACL command on a mailbox
   that the user has no permission to LIST, the server would respond to
   that request with the same error that would be used if the mailbox
   did not exist, thus revealing no existence information, much less the
   mailbox&#x27;s ACL.

   IMAP clients implementing ACL that are able to modify ACLs SHOULD
   warn a user that wants to give full access (or even just the &quot;a&quot;
   right) to the special identifier &quot;anyone&quot;.

   This document relies on [<a href="#ref-SASLprep">SASLprep</a>] to describe steps required to
   perform identifier canonicalization (preparation).  The preparation
   algorithm in SASLprep was specifically designed such that its output
   is canonical, and it is well-formed.  However, due to an anomaly
   [<a href="#ref-PR29">PR29</a>] in the specification of Unicode normalization, canonical
   equivalence is not guaranteed for a select few character sequences.
   Identifiers prepared with SASLprep can be stored and returned by an
   ACL server.  The anomaly affects ACL manipulation and evaluation of
   identifiers containing the selected character sequences.  These

   sequences, however, do not appear in well-formed text.  In order to
   address this problem, an ACL server MAY reject identifiers containing
   sequences described in [<a href="#ref-PR29">PR29</a>] by sending the tagged BAD response.
   This is in addition to the requirement to reject identifiers that
   fail SASLprep preparation as described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   Other security considerations described in [<a href="#ref-IMAP4">IMAP4</a>] are relevant to
   this document.  In particular, ACL information is sent in the clear
   over the network unless confidentiality protection is negotiated.

   This can be accomplished either by the use of STARTTLS, negotiated
   privacy protection in the AUTHENTICATE command, or some other
   protection mechanism.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Changes since <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a></span>

   1.   Changed the charset of &quot;identifier&quot; from US-ASCII to UTF-8.
   2.   Specified that mailbox deletion is controlled by the &quot;x&quot; right
        and EXPUNGE is controlled by the &quot;e&quot; right.
   3.   Added the &quot;t&quot; right that controls STORE \Deleted.  Redefined the
        &quot;d&quot; right to be a macro for &quot;e&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and possibly &quot;x&quot;.
   4.   Added the &quot;k&quot; right that controls CREATE.  Redefined the &quot;c&quot;
        right to be a macro for &quot;k&quot; and possibly &quot;x&quot;.
   5.   Specified that the &quot;a&quot; right also controls DELETEACL.
   6.   Specified that the &quot;r&quot; right also controls STATUS.
   7.   Removed the requirement to check the &quot;r&quot; right for CHECK, SEARCH
        and FETCH, as this is required for SELECT/EXAMINE to be
        successful.
   8.   LISTRIGHTS requires the &quot;a&quot; right on the mailbox (same as
        SETACL).
   9.   Deleted &quot;PARTIAL&quot;, this is a deprecated feature of <a href="/doc/html/rfc1730">RFC 1730</a>.
   10.  Specified that the &quot;w&quot; right controls setting flags other than
        \Seen and \Deleted on APPEND.  Also specified that the &quot;s&quot; right
        controls the \Seen flag and that the &quot;t&quot; right controls the
        \Deleted flag.
   11.  Specified that SUBSCRIBE is NOT allowed with the &quot;r&quot; right.
   12.  Specified that the &quot;l&quot; right controls SUBSCRIBE.
   13.  GETACL is NOT allowed with the &quot;r&quot; right, even though there are
        several implementations that allows that.  If a user only has
        &quot;r&quot; right, GETACL can disclose information about identifiers
        existing on the mail system.
   14.  Clarified that RENAME requires the &quot;k&quot; right for the new parent
        and the &quot;x&quot; right for the old name.
   15.  Added new section that describes which rights are required
        and/or checked when performing various IMAP commands.
   16.  Added mail client security considerations when dealing with
        special identifier &quot;anyone&quot;.
   17.  Clarified that negative rights are not the same as DELETEACL.
   18.  Added &quot;Compatibility with <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a>&quot; section.
   19.  Added section about mapping of ACL rights to READ-WRITE and
        READ-ONLY response codes.
   20.  Changed BNF to ABNF.
   21.  Added &quot;Implementation Notes&quot; section.
   22.  Updated &quot;References&quot; section.
   23.  Added more examples.
   24.  Clarified when the virtual &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; rights are returned in
        ACL, MYRIGHTS, and LISTRIGHTS responses.

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc4314">RFC 4314</a>                        IMAP ACL                   December 2005</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B" href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Compatibility with <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a></span>

   This non-normative section gives guidelines as to how an existing <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC</a>
   <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">2086</a> server implementation may be updated to comply with this
   document.

   This document splits the &quot;d&quot; right into several new different rights:
   &quot;t&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and possibly &quot;x&quot; (see <a href="#section-2.1.1">Section 2.1.1</a> for more details).  The
   &quot;d&quot; right remains for backward-compatibility, but it is a virtual
   right.  There are two approaches for <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a> server implementors to
   handle the &quot;d&quot; right and the new rights that have replaced it:

   a.  Tie &quot;t&quot;, &quot;e&quot; (and possibly &quot;x) together - almost no changes.
   b.  Implement separate &quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;e&quot;.  Return the &quot;d&quot; right in a
       MYRIGHTS response or an ACL response containing ACL information
       when any of the &quot;t&quot;, &quot;e&quot; (and &quot;x&quot;) is granted.

   In a similar manner this document splits the &quot;c&quot; right into several
   new different rights: &quot;k&quot; and possibly &quot;x&quot; (see <a href="#section-2.1.1">Section 2.1.1</a> for
   more details).  The &quot;c&quot; right remains for backwards-compatibility but
   it is a virtual right.  Again, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a> server implementors can
   choose to tie rights or to implement separate rights, as described
   above.

   Also check Sections <a href="#section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a> and <a href="#section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>, as well as <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>, to see
   other changes required.  Server implementors should check which
   rights are required to invoke different IMAP4 commands as described
   in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C" href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  Known Deficiencies</span>

   This specification has some known deficiencies including:

   1.  This is inadequate to provide complete read-write access to
       mailboxes protected by Unix-style rights bits because there is no
       equivalent to &quot;chown&quot; and &quot;chgrp&quot; commands nor is there a good
       way to discover such limitations are present.
   2.  Because this extension leaves the specific semantics of how
       rights are combined by the server as implementation defined, the
       ability to build a user-friendly interface is limited.
   3.  Users, groups, and special identifiers (e.g., anyone) exist in
       the same namespace.

   The work-in-progress &quot;ACL2&quot; extension is intended to redesign this
   extension to address these deficiencies without the constraint of
   backward-compatibility and may eventually supercede this facility.

   However, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2086">RFC 2086</a> is deployed in multiple implementations so this
   intermediate step, which fixes the straightforward deficiencies in a
   backward-compatible fashion, is considered worthwhile.
