Abstract

   The RTFM Traffic Measurement Architecture provides a general
   framework for describing and measuring network traffic flows.  Flows
   are defined in terms of their Address Attribute values and measured
   by a &#x27;Traffic Meter&#x27;.

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use in
   controlling an RTFM Traffic Meter, in particular for specifying the
   flows to be measured.  It also provides an efficient mechanism for
   retrieving flow data from the meter using SNMP. Security issues
   concerning the operation of traffic meters are summarised.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>  Introduction</span>

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for managing and collecting data
   from network Realtime Traffic Flow Meters, as described in [RTFM-
   ARC].

   The MIB is &#x27;basic&#x27; in the sense that it provides more than enough
   information for everyday traffic measurment.  Furthermore, it can be
   easily extended by adding new attributes as required.  The RTFM
   Working group is actively pursuing the development of the meter in
   this way.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>  The SNMP Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   - An overall architecture, described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2571">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2571" title="&quot;An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks&quot;">RFC2571</a>].

   - Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
     16, <a href="/doc/html/rfc1155">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1155" title="&quot;Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets&quot;">RFC1155</a>], STD 16, <a href="/doc/html/rfc1212">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1212" title="&quot;Concise MIB Definitions&quot;">RFC1212</a>] and <a href="/doc/html/rfc1215">RFC 1215</a>
     [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1215" title="&quot;A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP&quot;">RFC1215</a>].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
     58, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2578">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2578" title="&quot;Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)&quot;">RFC2578</a>], <a href="/doc/html/rfc2579">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2579" title="&quot;Textual Conventions for SMIv2&quot;">RFC2579</a>] and <a href="/doc/html/rfc2580">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2580" title="&quot;Conformance Statements for SMIv2&quot;">RFC2580</a>].

   - Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in STD 15, <a href="/doc/html/rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1157" title="&quot;Simple Network Management Protocol&quot;">RFC1157</a>].  A second version of the
     SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1901">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1901" title="&quot;Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2&quot;">RFC1901</a>] and
     <a href="/doc/html/rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1906" title="&quot;Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)&quot;">RFC1906</a>].  The third version of the message protocol is
     called SNMPv3 and described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1906">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1906" title="&quot;Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)&quot;">RFC1906</a>], <a href="/doc/html/rfc2572">RFC 2572</a>
     [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2572" title="&quot;Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)&quot;">RFC2572</a>] and <a href="/doc/html/rfc2574">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2574" title="&quot;User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)&quot;">RFC2574</a>].

   - Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
     described in STD 15, <a href="/doc/html/rfc1157">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1157" title="&quot;Simple Network Management Protocol&quot;">RFC1157</a>].  A second set of protocol
     operations and associated PDU formats is described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc1905">RFC 1905</a>
     [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1905" title="&quot;Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)&quot;">RFC1905</a>].

<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc2720">RFC 2720</a>          Traffic Flow Measurement: Meter MIB       October 1999</span>


   - A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2573">RFC 2573</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2573" title="&quot;SNMPv3 Applications&quot;">RFC2573</a>]
     and the view-based access control mechanism described in <a href="/doc/html/rfc2575">RFC 2575</a>
     [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2575" title="&quot;View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)&quot;">RFC2575</a>].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2570" title="&quot;Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework&quot;">RFC2570</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>  Overview</span>

   Traffic Flow Measurement seeks to provide a well-defined method for
   gathering traffic flow information from networks and internetworks.
   The background for this is given in &quot;Internet Accounting Background&quot;
   [<a href="#ref-ACT-BKG" title="&quot;Internet Accounting Background&quot;">ACT-BKG</a>]. The Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (rtfm) Working Group
   has produced a measurement architecture to achieve this goal; this is
   documented in &quot;Traffic Flow Measurement:  Architecture&quot; [<a href="#ref-RTFM-ARC" title="&quot;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&quot;">RTFM-ARC</a>].
   The architecture defines three entities:

   - METERS, which observe network traffic flows and build up a table of
     flow data records for them,

   - METER READERS, which collect traffic flow data from meters, and

   - MANAGERS, which oversee the operation of meters and meter readers.

   This memo defines the SNMP management information for a Traffic Flow
   Meter (TFM). Work in this field was begun by the Internet Accounting
   Working Group.  It has been further developed and expanded by the
   Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement Working Group.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>  Scope of Definitions, Textual Conventions</span>

   All objects defined in this memo are registered in a single subtree
   within the mib-2 namespace [MIB-II, <a href="/doc/html/rfc2578">RFC2578</a>], and are for use in
   network devices which may perform a PDU forwarding or monitoring
   function.  For these devices, this MIB defines a group of objects
   with an SMI Network Management MGMT Code [<a href="#ref-ASG-NBR" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">ASG-NBR</a>] of 40, i.e.

   flowMIB OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  mib-2 40

   as defined below.

   The RTFM Meter MIB was first produced and tested using SNMPv1.  It
   was converted into SNMPv2 following the guidelines in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1908" title="&quot;Coexistence between version 1 and version 2 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework&quot;">RFC1908</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>  Usage of the MIB variables</span>

   The MIB is organised in four parts - control, data, rules and
   conformance statements.

   The rules implement the set of packet-matching actions, as described
   in the &quot;Traffic Flow Measurment:  Architecture&quot; document [<a href="#ref-RTFM-ARC" title="&quot;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&quot;">RTFM-ARC</a>].
   In addition they provide for BASIC-style subroutines, allowing a
   network manager to dramatically reduce the number of rules required
   to monitor a large network.

   Traffic flows are identified by a set of attributes for each of their
   end-points.  Attributes include network addresses for each layer of
   the network protocol stack, and &#x27;subscriber ids&#x27;, which may be used
   to identify an accountable entity for the flow.

   The conformance statements are set out as defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2580" title="&quot;Conformance Statements for SMIv2&quot;">RFC2580</a>].  They
   explain what must be implemented in a meter which claims to conform
   to this MIB.

   To retrieve flow data one could simply do a linear scan of the flow
   table.  This would certainly work, but would require a lot of
   protocol exchanges.  To reduce the overhead in retrieving flow data
   the flow table uses a TimeFilter variable, defined as a Textual
   Convention in the RMON2 MIB [<a href="#ref-RMON2-MIB" title="&quot;Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2&quot;">RMON2-MIB</a>].

   As an alternative method of reading flow data, the MIB provides a
   view of the flow table called the flowDataPackageTable.  This is
   (logically) a four-dimensional array, subscripted by package
   selector, RuleSet, activity time and starting flow number.  The
   package selector is a sequence of bytes which specifies a list of
   flow attributes.

   A data package (as returned by the meter) is a sequence of values for
   the attributes specified in its selector, encoded using the Basic
   Encoding Rules [<a href="#ref-ASN-BER" title="International Organization for Standardization">ASN-BER</a>]. It allows a meter reader to retrieve all
   the attribute values it requires in a single MIB object.  This, when
   used together with SNMPv2&#x27;s GetBulk request, allows a meter reader to
   scan the flow table and upload a specified set of attribute values
   for flows which have changed since the last reading, and which were
   created by a specified rule set.

   One aspect of data collection which needs emphasis is that all the
   MIB variables are set up to allow multiple independent meter readers
   to work properly, i.e. the flow table indexes are stateless.  An
   alternative approach would have been to &#x27;snapshot&#x27; the flow table,
   which would mean that the meter readers would have to be
   synchronized.  The stateless approach does mean that two meter
   readers will never return exactly the same set of traffic counts, but
   over long periods (e.g. 15-minute collections over a day) the
   discrepancies are acceptable.  If one really needs a snapshot, this
   can be achieved by switching to an identical rule set with a
   different RuleSet number, hence asynchronous collections may be
   regarded as a useful generalisation of synchronised ones.

   The control variables are the minimum set required for a meter
   reader.  Their number has been whittled down as experience has been
   gained with the MIB implementation.  A few of them are &#x27;general&#x27;,
   i.e. they control the overall behaviour of the meter.  These are set
   by a single &#x27;master&#x27; manager, and no other manager should attempt to
   change their values.  The decision as to which manager is the &#x27;
   master&#x27; must be made by the network operations personnel responsible;
   this MIB does not attempt to define any interaction between managers.

   There are three other groups of control variables, arranged into
   tables in the same way as in the RMON2 MIB [<a href="#ref-RMON2-MIB" title="&quot;Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2&quot;">RMON2-MIB</a>]. They are used
   as follows:

   - RULE SET INFO: Before attempting to download a RuleSet, a manager
     must create a row in the flowRuleSetInfoTable and set its
     flowRuleInfoSize to a value large enough to hold the RuleSet.  When
     the rule set is ready the manager must set flowRuleInfoRulesReady
     to &#x27;true&#x27;, indicating that the rule set is ready for use (but not
     yet &#x27;running&#x27;).

   - METER READER INFO: Any meter reader wishing to collect data
     reliably for all flows from a RuleSet should first create a row in
     the flowReaderInfoTable with flowReaderRuleSet set to that
     RuleSet&#x27;s index in the flowRuleSetInfoTable.  It should write that
     row&#x27;s flowReaderLastTime object each time it starts a collection

     pass through the flow table.  The meter will not recover a flow&#x27;s
     memory until every meter reader holding a row for that flow&#x27;s
     RuleSet has collected the flow&#x27;s data.

   - MANAGER INFO: Any manager wishing to run a RuleSet in the meter
     must create a row in the flowManagerInfo table, specifying the
     desired RuleSet to run and its corresponding &#x27;standby&#x27; RuleSet (if
     one is desired).  A current RuleSet is &#x27;running&#x27; if its
     flowManagerRunningStandby value is false(2), similarly a standby
     RuleSet is &#x27;running&#x27; if flowManagerRunningStandby is true(1).

   Times within the meter are in terms of its Uptime, i.e. centiseconds
   since the meter started.  For meters implemented as self-contained
   SNMP agents this will be the same as sysUptime, but this may not be
   true for meters implemented as subagents.  Managers can read the
   meter&#x27;s Uptime when neccessary (e.g. to set a TimeFilter value) by
   setting flowReaderLastTime, then reading its new value.

flowRuleSetInfoTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX  SEQUENCE OF FlowRuleSetInfoEntry
    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
        &quot;An array of information about the RuleSets held in the
        meter.

        Any manager may configure a new RuleSet for the meter by
        creating a row in this table with status active(1), and setting
        values for all the objects in its rules.  At this stage the new
        RuleSet is available but not &#x27;running&#x27;, i.e. it is not being
        used by the meter to produce entries in the flow table.

        To actually &#x27;run&#x27; a RuleSet a manager must create a row in
        the flowManagerInfoTable, set it&#x27;s flowManagerStatus to
        active(1), and set either its CurrentRuleSet or StandbyRuleSet
        to point to the RuleSet to be run.

        Once a RuleSet is running a manager may not change any of the
        objects within the RuleSet itself.  Any attempt to do so should
        result in a notWritable(17) SNMP error-status for such objects.

        A manager may stop a RuleSet running by removing all
        references to it in the flowManagerInfoTable (i.e. by setting
        CurrentRuleSet and StandbyRuleSet values to 0).  This provides

        a way to stop RuleSets left running if a manager fails.
        For example, when a manager is started, it could search the
        meter&#x27;s flowManager table and stop all RuleSets having a
        specified value of flowRuleInfoOwner.

        To prevent a manager from interfering with variables belonging
        to another manager, the meter should use MIB views [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2575" title="&quot;View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)&quot;">RFC2575</a>] so
        as to limit each manager&#x27;s access to the meter&#x27;s variables,
        effectively dividing the single meter into several virtual
        meters, one for each independent manager.&quot;

        &quot;The status of this flowRuleSetInfoEntry. If this value is
        not active(1) the meter must not attempt to use the row&#x27;s
        associated RuleSet.  Once its value has been set to active(1)
        a manager may not change any of the other variables in the
        row, nor the contents of the associated RuleSet.  Any attempt
        to do so should result in a notWritable(17) SNMP error-status
        for such variables or objects.

        To download a RuleSet, a manger could:
           - Locate an open slot in the RuleSetInfoTable.
           - Create a RuleSetInfoEntry by setting the status for this
               open slot to createAndWait(5).
           - Set flowRuleInfoSize and flowRuleInfoName as required.
           - Download the rules into the row&#x27;s rule table.
           - Set flowRuleInfoStatus to active(1).

        The RuleSet would then be ready to run. The manager is not
        allowed to change the value of flowRuleInfoStatus from
        active(1) if the associated RuleSet is being referenced by any
        of the entries in the flowManagerInfoTable.

        Setting RuleInfoStatus to destroy(6) destroys the associated
        RuleSet together with any flow data collected by it.&quot;

        that the meter &#x27;run&#x27; the indicated RuleSet.

        The entry also specifies a HighWaterMark and a StandbyRuleSet.
        If the meter&#x27;s flow table usage exceeds this task&#x27;s
        HighWaterMark the meter will stop running the task&#x27;s
        CurrentRuleSet and switch to its StandbyRuleSet.

        If the value of the task&#x27;s StandbyRuleSet is 0 when its
        HighWaterMark is exceeded, the meter simply stops running the
        task&#x27;s CurrentRuleSet.  By careful selection of HighWaterMarks
        for the various tasks a manager can ensure that the most
        critical RuleSets are the last to stop running as the number
        of flows increases.

        When a manager has determined that the demand for flow table

    DESCRIPTION
        &quot;Indicates that the meter has passed its FloodMark and is
        not running in its normal mode.

        When the manager notices this it should take action to remedy
        the problem which caused the flooding.  It should then monitor
        flowActiveFlows so as to determine when the flood has receded.
        At that point the manager may set flowFloodMode to false(2) to
        resume normal operation.&quot;

--
-- The Flow Table
--

-- This is a table kept by a meter, with one flow data entry for every
-- flow being measured.  Each flow data entry stores the attribute
-- values for a traffic flow.  Details of flows and their attributes
-- are given in the &#x27;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&#x27;
-- document [<a href="#ref-RTFM-ARC" title="&quot;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&quot;">RTFM-ARC</a>].

-- From time to time a meter reader may sweep the flow table so as
-- to read counts.  This is most effectively achieved by using the
-- TimeMark variable together with successive GetBulk requests to
-- retrieve the values of the desired flow attribute variables.

-- This scheme allows multiple meter readers to independently use the
-- same meter; the meter readers do not have to be synchronised and
-- they may use different collection intervals.

-- If identical sets of counts are required from a meter, a manager
-- could achieve this using two identical copies of a RuleSet in that
-- meter and switching back and forth between them.  This is discussed
-- further in the RTFM Architecture document [<a href="#ref-RTFM-ARC" title="&quot;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&quot;">RTFM-ARC</a>].

-- The Rule Table
--

-- This is an array of RuleSets; the &#x27;running&#x27; ones are indicated
-- by the entries in the meter&#x27;s flowManagerInfoTable.  Several
-- RuleSets can be held in a meter so that the manager can change the
-- running RuleSets easily, for example with time of day.  Note that
-- a manager may not change the rules in any RuleSet currently
-- referenced within the flowManagerInfoTable (either as &#x27;current&#x27; or
-- &#x27;standby&#x27;)!  See the &#x27;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&#x27;
-- document [<a href="#ref-RTFM-ARC" title="&quot;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&quot;">RTFM-ARC</a>] for details of rules and how they are used.

-- Space for a RuleSet is allocated by setting the value of
-- flowRuleInfoSize in the rule table&#x27;s flowRuleSetInfoTable row.
-- Values for each row in the RuleSet (Selector, Mask, MatchedValue,
-- Action and Parameter) can then be set by the meter.

-- Although an individual rule within a RuleSet could be modified,
-- it is much safer to simply download a complete new RuleSet.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>  Security Considerations</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>  SNMP Concerns</span>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  These include all the objects in the Control
   Group (since they control access to meter resources by Managers and
   Meter Readers) and those in the Flow Table (since they hold the
   collected traffic flow data).

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2574" title="&quot;User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)&quot;">RFC2574</a>] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2575" title="&quot;View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)&quot;">RFC2575</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>  Traffic Meter Concerns</span>

   This MIB describes how an RTFM traffic meter is controlled, and
   provides a way for traffic flow data to be retrieved from it by a
   meter reader.  This is essentially an application using SNMP as a
   method of communication between co-operating hosts; it does not - in
   itself - have any inherent security risks.






<span class="grey">Brownlee                    Standards Track                    [Page 47]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-48" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc2720">RFC 2720</a>          Traffic Flow Measurement: Meter MIB       October 1999</span>


   Since, however, the traffic flow data can be extremely valuable for
   network management purposes it is vital that sensible precautions be
   taken to keep the meter and its data secure.  In particular, an
   attacker must not be permitted to write any of the meter&#x27;s variables!
   This requires that access to the meter for control purposes (e.g.
   loading RuleSets and reading flow data) be restricted.  Such
   restriction could be achieved in many ways, for example:

   - Physical Separation.  Meter(s) and meter reader(s) could be
     deployed so that control capabilities are kept within a separate
     network, access to which is carefully controlled.

   - Application-layer Security.  A minimal level of security for SNMP
     can be provided by using &#x27;community&#x27; strings (which are essentially
     clear-text passwords) with SNMPv2C [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1157" title="&quot;Simple Network Management Protocol&quot;">RFC1157</a>].  Where stronger
     security is needed, users should consider using the User-based
     Security Model [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2574" title="&quot;User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)&quot;">RFC2574</a>] and the View-based Access Control Model
     [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2575" title="&quot;View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)&quot;">RFC2575</a>].

   - Lower-layer Security.  Access to the meter can be protected using
     encryption at the network layer.  For example, one could run SNMP
     to the meter through an encrypted TCP tunnel.

   When implementing a meter it may be sensible to use separate network
   interfaces for control and for metering.  If this is done the control
   network can be set up so that it doesn&#x27;t carry any &#x27;user&#x27; traffic,
   and the metering interfaces can ignore any user attempts to take
   control of the meter.

   Users should also consider how they will address attempts to
   circumvent a meter, i.e. to prevent it from measuring flows.  Such
   attempts are essentially denial-of-service attacks on the metering
   interfaces.  For example

   - Port Scan attacks.  The attacker sends packets to each of a very
     large number of IP (Address :  Port) pairs.  Each of these packets
     creates a new flow in the meter; if there are enough of them the
     meter will recognise a &#x27;flood&#x27; condition, and will probably stop
     creating new flows.  As a minimum, users (and implementors) should
     ensure that meters can recover from flood conditions as soon as
     possible after they occur.

   - Counter Wrap attacks:  The attacker sends enough packets to cause
     the counters in a flow to wrap several times between meter
     readings, thus causing the counts to be artificially low.  The
     change to using 64-bit counters in this MIB reduces this problem
     significantly.

   Users can reduce the severity of both the above attacks by ensuring
   that their meters are read often enough to prevent them being
   flooded.  The resulting flow data will contain a record of the
   attacking packets, which may well be useful in determining where any
   attack came from.

   The RTFM Architecture document [<a href="#ref-RTFM-ARC" title="&quot;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&quot;">RTFM-ARC</a>], has two sets of assigned
   numbers:  Opcodes for the PME (Pattern Matching Engine) and RTFM
   Attribute numbers.  All the assigned numbers used in the Meter MIB
   appear in Textual Conventions.  The numbers they use are derived as
   follows:

   The MIB&#x27;s &#x27;Type&#x27; textual conventions use names and numbers from the
   Assigned Numbers RFC [<a href="#ref-ASG-NBR" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">ASG-NBR</a>]:

      MediumType            Uses ifType Definitions
      PeerType              Uses Address Family Numbers
      TransportType         Uses Protocol Numbers

   The MIB&#x27;s &#x27;AttributeNumber&#x27; textual conventions use RTFM Attribute
   names and numbers from the RTFM Architecture document [<a href="#ref-RTFM-ARC" title="&quot;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&quot;">RTFM-ARC</a>], or
   other numbers allocated according to that document&#x27;s IANA
   Considerations section:

      FlowAttributeNumber   Have values stored in a flow table row
      RuleAttributeNumber   May be tested in a rule

   The MIB&#x27;s ActionNumber textual convention uses RTFM PME Opcode names
   and numbers from the RTFM Architecture document [<a href="#ref-RTFM-ARC" title="&quot;Traffic Flow Measurement: Architecture&quot;">RTFM-ARC</a>], or other
   numbers allocated according to that document&#x27;s IANA Considerations
   section.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>: Changes Introduced Since <a href="/doc/html/rfc2064">RFC 2064</a></span>

   The first version of the Meter MIB was published as <a href="/doc/html/rfc2064">RFC 2064</a> in
   January 1997.  The most significant changes since then are summarised
   below.

   - TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS: Greater use is made of textual conventions to
     describe the various types of addresses used by the meter.

   - PACKET MATCHING ATTRIBUTES: Computed attributes (e.g. FlowClass and
     FlowKind) may now be tested.  This allows one to use these
     variables to store information during packet matching.

     A new attribute, MatchingStoD, has been added.  Its value is 1
     while a packet is being matched with its adresses in &#x27;wire&#x27;
     (source-to-destination) order.

   - FLOOD MODE: This is now a read-write variable.  Setting it to
     false(2) switches the meter out of flood mode and back to normal
     operation.

   - CONTROL TABLES: Several variables have been added to the RuleSet,
     Reader and Manager tables to provide more effective control of the
     meter&#x27;s activities.

   - FLOW TABLE: 64-bit counters are used for octet and PDU counts.
     This reduces the problems caused by the wrap-around of 32-bit
     counters in earlier versions.
     flowDataRuleSet is now used as an index to the flow table.  This
     allows a meter reader to collect only those flow table rows created
     by a specified RuleSet.

   - DATA PACKAGES: This is a new table, allowing a meter reader to
     retrieve values for a list of attributes from a flow as a single
     object (a BER-encoded sequence [<a href="#ref-ASN-1" title="International Standard 8824">ASN-1</a>, <a href="#ref-ASN-BER" title="International Organization for Standardization">ASN-BER</a>]). It provides an
     efficient way to recover flow data, particularly when used with
     SNMP GetBulk requests.

     Earlier versions had a &#x27;Column Activity Table&#x27;; using this it was
     difficult to collect all data for a flow efficiently in a single
     SNMP request.
