Abstract

   Photuris is a session-key management protocol.  Extensible Exchange-
   Schemes are provided to enable future implementation changes without
   affecting the basic protocol.

   Additional authentication attributes are included for use with the IP
   Authentication Header (AH) or the IP Encapsulating Security Protocol
   (ESP).

   Additional confidentiality attributes are included for use with ESP.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Additional Exchange-Schemes</span>

   The packet format and basic facilities are already defined for
   Photuris [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2522">RFC-2522</a>].

   These optional Exchange-Schemes are specified separately, and no
   single implementation is expected to support all of them.

   This document defines the following values:

   (3)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 3.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         An Exchange-Scheme Size of zero is invalid.

         Key-Generation-Function     &quot;MD5 Hash&quot;
         Privacy-Method              &quot;Simple Masking&quot;
         Validity-Method             &quot;MD5-IPMAC Check&quot;

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (4)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 2.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         When the Exchange-Scheme Size field is zero, includes by
         reference all of the moduli specified in the list of Offered-
         Schemes for Scheme #2.

         Key-Generation-Function     &quot;MD5 Hash&quot;
         Privacy-Method              &quot;DES-CBC over Mask&quot;
         Validity-Method             &quot;MD5-IPMAC Check&quot;

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (5)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 5.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         An Exchange-Scheme Size of zero is invalid.

         Key-Generation-Function     &quot;MD5 Hash&quot;
         Privacy-Method              &quot;Simple Masking&quot;
         Validity-Method             &quot;MD5-IPMAC Check&quot;

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (6)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 3.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         When the Exchange-Scheme Size field is zero, includes by
         reference all of the moduli specified in the list of Offered-
         Schemes for Scheme #3.

         Key-Generation-Function     &quot;MD5 Hash&quot;
         Privacy-Method              &quot;DES-CBC over Mask&quot;
         Validity-Method             &quot;MD5-IPMAC Check&quot;

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (7)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a variable
         generator (g).  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero, the
         pair [g,p] is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.  Each is encoded in a separate
         Variable Precision Integer (VPI).  The generator VPI is
         followed by (concatenated to) the modulus VPI, and the result
         is nested inside the Exchange-Scheme Value field.

         An Exchange-Scheme Size of zero is invalid.

         Key-Generation-Function     &quot;MD5 Hash&quot;
         Privacy-Method              &quot;Simple Masking&quot;
         Validity-Method             &quot;MD5-IPMAC Check&quot;

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

         When more than one modulus is specified for a given kind of
         Scheme, the Size of the modulus MUST be unique, independent of
         the Size of the generator.

   (8)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 2.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in

         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         When the Exchange-Scheme Size field is zero, includes by
         reference all of the moduli specified in the list of Offered-
         Schemes for Schemes #2 and #4.

         Key-Generation-Function     &quot;SHA1 Hash&quot;

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least
         112-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (10)  Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 5.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero,

   SHA1 [<a href="#ref-FIPS-180-1">FIPS-180-1</a>] is used as a pseudo-random-function for generating
   the key(s).  The key(s) begin with the most significant bits of the
   hash.  SHA1 is iterated as needed to generate the requisite length of
   key material.

   When an individual key does not use all 160-bits of the last hash,
   any remaining unused (least significant) bits of the last hash are
   discarded.  When combined with other uses of key generation for the
   same purpose, the next key will begin with a new hash iteration.

   As described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2522">RFC-2522</a>] &quot;Privacy-Key Computation&quot;, sufficient
   privacy-key material is generated to match the message length,
   beginning with the next field after the SPI, and including the
   Padding.  The message is masked by XOR with the privacy-key.

   Then, the Key-Generation-Function is iterated to generate a DES key.
   The most significant 64-bits (8 bytes) of the generated hash are used
   for the privacy-key, and the remainder are discarded.  Although
   extremely rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys
   [Schneier95, pages 280-282] are discarded.  The Key-Generation-
   Function is iterated until a valid key is obtained.

   The least significant bit of each key byte is ignored (or set to
   parity when the implementation requires).

   The 64-bit CBC IV is zero.  Message encryption begins with the next
   field after the SPI, and continues to the end of the data indicated

   This is &quot;Triple DES&quot; outer-CBC EDE encryption (and DED decryption)
   with three 56-bit keys [<a href="#ref-KR96">KR96</a>].

   As described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2522">RFC-2522</a>] &quot;Privacy-Key Computation&quot;, sufficient
   privacy-key material is generated to match the message length,
   beginning with the next field after the SPI, and including the
   Padding.  The message is masked by XOR with the privacy-key.

   Then, the Key-Generation-Function is iterated (at least) three times
   to generate the three DES keys.  The most significant 64-bits (8
   bytes) of each generated hash are used for each successive privacy-
   key, and the remainder are discarded.  Each key is examined
   sequentially, in the order used for encryption.  A key that is
   identical to a previous key MUST be discarded.  Although extremely
   rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95,
   pages 280-282] MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is
   iterated until a valid key is obtained before generating the next
   key.

   In all three keys, the least significant bit of each key byte is
   ignored (or set to parity when the implementation requires).

   The 64-bit CBC IV is zero.  Message encryption begins with the next
   field after the SPI, and continues to the end of the data indicated

   For example, the combination

      &quot;DES-CBC&quot;,
      &quot;Invert&quot;,
      &quot;DES-CBC&quot;,
      &quot;DES-CBC&quot;,

   indicates &quot;Triple DES&quot; outer-CBC EDE encryption (and DED decryption)
   with three keys [<a href="#ref-KR96">KR96</a>] pursuant to [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1851">RFC-1851</a>] et sequitur.  The
   selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide at least 112-bits of
   cryptographic strength.

   As described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2522">RFC-2522</a>] &quot;Session-Key Computation&quot;, the Key-
   Generation-Function is iterated (at least) three times to generate
   the three independent keys, in the order used for encryption.  The
   most significant 64-bits (8 bytes) of each iteration are used for
   each successive key, and the remainder are discarded.

   Each key is examined sequentially, in the order used for encryption.
   A key that is identical to any previous key MUST be discarded.  Any
   weak keys indicated for the algorithm MUST be discarded.  The Key-
   Generation-Function is iterated until a valid key is obtained before
   generating the next key.

   Profile:

      When negotiated with Photuris, the &quot;DES-EDE3-CBC&quot; transform
      differs slightly from [<a href="/doc/html/rfc1851">RFC-1851</a>], in the same fashion as &quot;DES-CBC&quot;
      (described earlier).

   indicates &quot;DESX&quot; encryption with three keys [<a href="#ref-KR96">KR96</a>].  The selected
   Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide at least 104-bits of cryptographic
   strength.

   As described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2522">RFC-2522</a>] &quot;Session-Key Computation&quot;, the Key-

   most significant bytes of each iteration are used for each successive
   key, and the remainder are discarded.

   Note that this attribute may appear multiple times in the same ESP
   attribute list, both before and after an encryption transform.  For
   example,

      &quot;XOR&quot;,
      &quot;DES-CBC&quot;,
      &quot;XOR&quot;,
      &quot;Invert&quot;,
      &quot;DES-CBC&quot;,
      &quot;XOR&quot;,
      &quot;DES-CBC&quot;,
      &quot;XOR&quot;,

   would be one possible combination with Triple DES.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A" href="#appendix-A">A</a>.  Exchange-Scheme Selection</span>

   At first glance, there appear to be a large number of exchange-
   schemes.  In practice, the selection is simple to automate.

   Each scheme indicates a needed strength.  This strength is based upon
   the functions used in protecting the Photuris Exchanges themselves.

   Each keyed attribute also indicates a needed strength.  This strength
   is based upon its cryptographic functions.

   Because the usage of these functions is orthogonal, the same strength
   value can select an appropriate scheme that meets the needs of both
   features.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.1" href="#appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Responder</span>

   The attributes to be offered to the particular Initiator are
   examined.  For each level of strength specified, a scheme that meets
   or exceeds the requirements is offered.

   For example, a Responder offering MD5-IPMAC and SHA1-IPMAC might
   offer scheme #2 with a 512-bit modulus and a 1024-bit modulus, and
   scheme #4 with a zero Size (indicating moduli of #2).


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-A.2" href="#appendix-A.2">A.2</a>.  Initiator</span>

   The strength indicated by the application for the Security
   Association, together with the party privacy policy of the system
   operator, is used to select from the offered schemes.  The strength
   indicates the minimal level to be chosen, while the party privacy
   policy indicates whether to choose the minimal or maximal level of
   available protection.

   For example, an application might indicate that it desires 80-bits of
   strength.  In that case, only the 1024-bit modulus would be
   appropriate.  The party privacy policy of the system operator would
   indicate whether to choose scheme #2 with &quot;Simple Masking&quot; or scheme
   #4 with &quot;DES-CBC over Mask&quot;.

   Alternatively, an application might indicate that it desires 64-bits
   of strength.  The party privacy policy of the system operator would
   indicate whether to choose scheme #2 with the 512-bit modulus, or
   scheme #4 with the 1024-bit modulus.

Security Considerations

   Provision for multiple generators does not enhance the security of
   the Photuris protocol exchange itself.  Rather, it provides an
   opportunity for novelty of moduli, by allowing more forms of moduli
   to be used.  An abundance of moduli inhibits a determined attacker
   from pre-calculating moduli exchange values, and discourages
   dedication of resources for analysis of any particular modulus.  That
   is, this protects the community of Photuris users.

   In addition to preventing various attacks by protecting verification
   fields, the masking of the message plaintext before encryption is
   intended to obscure the relation of the number of parties and SPIs
   active between two IP nodes.  The privacy mask dependency on the SPI
   and SPILT generates a different initial encrypted block for every SPI
   creation message.

   This obscurement would be less effective when the SPI and SPILT are
   invariant or are not created for a particular exchange direction.
   The number of parties could be revealed by the number of exchanges
   with differences in the initial encrypted blocks.


Acknowledgements

   Phil Karn was principally responsible for the design of party privacy
   protection, and provided much of the design rationale text (now
   removed to a separate document).

   William Simpson was responsible for the packet formats, and
   additional Exchange-Schemes, editing and formatting.  All such
   mistakes are his responsibity.

   Use of encryption for privacy protection is also found in the
   Station-To-Station authentication protocol [<a href="#ref-DOW92">DOW92</a>].

   Bart Preneel and Paul C van Oorschot in [<a href="#ref-PO96">PO96</a>] recommended padding
   between the data and trailing key when hashing for authentication.

   Niels Provos developed the first implementation with multiple schemes
   and multiple moduli per scheme (circa July 1997).

   (CITI) for providing computing resources.
