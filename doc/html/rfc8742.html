Abstract

   This document describes the Concise Binary Object Representation
   (CBOR) Sequence format and associated media type &quot;application/cbor-
   seq&quot;.  A CBOR Sequence consists of any number of encoded CBOR data
   items, simply concatenated in sequence.

   Structured syntax suffixes for media types allow other media types to
   build on them and make it explicit that they are built on an existing
   media type as their foundation.  This specification defines and
   registers &quot;+cbor-seq&quot; as a structured syntax suffix for CBOR
   Sequences.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] can be used
   for serialization of data in the JSON [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8259" title="&quot;The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format&quot;">RFC8259</a>] data model or in its
   own, somewhat expanded, data model.  When serializing a sequence of
   such values, it is sometimes convenient to have a format where these
   sequences can simply be concatenated to obtain a serialization of the
   concatenated sequence of values or to encode a sequence of values
   that might grow at the end by just appending further CBOR data items.

   This document describes the concept and format of &quot;CBOR Sequences&quot;,
   which are composed of zero or more encoded CBOR data items.  CBOR
   Sequences can be consumed (and produced) incrementally without
   requiring a streaming CBOR parser that is able to deliver
   substructures of a data item incrementally (or a streaming encoder
   able to encode from substructures incrementally).

   This document defines and registers the &quot;application/cbor-seq&quot; media
   type in the &quot;Media Types&quot; registry along with a Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) Content-Format identifier.  Media type
   structured syntax suffixes [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6838" title="&quot;Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures&quot;">RFC6838</a>] were introduced as a way for a
   media type to signal that it is based on another media type as its
   foundation.  CBOR [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] defines the &quot;+cbor&quot; structured syntax
   suffix.  This document defines and registers the &quot;+cbor-seq&quot;
   structured syntax suffix in the &quot;Structured Syntax Suffix Registry&quot;.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="/doc/html/rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>] [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8174" title="&quot;Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words&quot;">RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this specification, the term &quot;byte&quot; is used in its now-customary
   sense as a synonym for &quot;octet&quot;.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  CBOR Sequence Format</span>

   Formally, a CBOR Sequence is a sequence of bytes that is recursively
   defined as either of the following:

   *  an empty (zero-length) sequence of bytes

   *  the sequence of bytes making up an encoded CBOR data item
      [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] followed by a CBOR Sequence.

   In short, concatenating zero or more encoded CBOR data items
   generates a CBOR Sequence.  (Consequently, concatenating zero or more
   CBOR Sequences also results in a CBOR Sequence.)

   There is no end-of-sequence indicator.  (If one is desired, CBOR
   encoding an array of the CBOR data model values being encoded,
   employing either a definite or an indefinite length encoding, as a
   single CBOR data item may actually be the more appropriate
   representation.)

   CBOR Sequences, unlike JSON Text Sequences [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7464" title="&quot;JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Text Sequences&quot;">RFC7464</a>], do not use a
   marker between items.  This is possible because CBOR-encoded data
   items are self delimiting and the end can always be calculated.
   (Note that, while the early object/array-only form of JSON was self
   delimiting as well, this stopped being the case when simple values
   such as single numbers were made valid JSON documents.)

   Decoding a CBOR Sequence works as follows:

   *  If the CBOR Sequence is an empty sequence of bytes, the result is
      an empty sequence of CBOR data model values.

   *  Otherwise, one must decode a single CBOR data item from the bytes
      of the CBOR Sequence and insert the resulting CBOR data model
      value at the start of the result of repeating this decoding
      process recursively with the remaining bytes.  (A streaming
      decoder would therefore simply deliver zero or more CBOR data
      model values, each as soon as the bytes making it up are
      available.)

   This means that if any data item in the sequence is not well formed,
   it is not possible to reliably decode the rest of the sequence.  (An
   implementation may be able to recover from some errors in a sequence
   of bytes that is almost, but not entirely, a well-formed encoded CBOR
   data item.  Handling malformed data is outside the scope of this
   specification.)

   This also means that the CBOR Sequence format can reliably detect
   truncation of the bytes making up the last CBOR data item in the
   sequence, but it cannot detect entirely missing CBOR data items at
   the end.  A CBOR Sequence decoder that is used for consuming
   streaming CBOR Sequence data may simply pause for more data (e.g., by
   suspending and later resuming decoding) in case a truncated final
   item is being received.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  The &quot;+cbor-seq&quot; Structured Syntax Suffix</span>

   The use case for the &quot;+cbor-seq&quot; structured syntax suffix is
   analogous to that for &quot;+cbor&quot;: it SHOULD be used by a media type when
   the result of parsing the bytes of the media type object as a CBOR
   Sequence is meaningful and is at least sometimes not just a single
   CBOR data item.  (Without the qualification at the end, this sentence
   is trivially true for any +cbor media type, which of course should
   continue to use the &quot;+cbor&quot; structured syntax suffix.)

   Applications encountering a &quot;+cbor-seq&quot; media type can then either
   simply use generic processing if all they need is a generic view of
   the CBOR Sequence or use generic CBOR Sequence tools for initial
   parsing and then implement their own specific processing on top of
   that generic parsing tool.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Specifying CBOR Sequences in Concise Data Definition Language</span>
      (CDDL)

   In Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8610" title="&quot;Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL): A Notational Convention to Express Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and JSON Data Structures&quot;">RFC8610</a>], CBOR Sequences
   are already supported as contents of byte strings using the
   &quot;.cborseq&quot; control operator (<a href="/doc/html/rfc8610#section-3.8.4">Section&nbsp;3.8.4 of [RFC8610]</a>) by employing
   an array as the controller type:

   my-embedded-cbor-seq = bytes .cborseq my-array
   my-array = [* my-element]
   my-element = my-foo / my-bar

   Currently, CDDL does not provide for unadorned CBOR Sequences as a
   top-level subject of a specification.  For now, the suggestion is to
   use an array for the top-level rule, as is used for the &quot;.cborseq&quot;
   control operator, and add English text that explains that the
   specification is really about a CBOR Sequence with the elements of
   the array:

   ; This defines an array, the elements of which are to be used
   ; in a CBOR Sequence:
   my-sequence = [* my-element]
   my-element = my-foo / my-bar

   (Future versions of CDDL may provide a notation for top-level CBOR
   Sequences, e.g., by using a group as the top-level rule in a CDDL
   specification.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Diagnostic Notation</span>

   CBOR diagnostic notation (see <a href="/doc/html/rfc7049#section-6">Section&nbsp;6 of [RFC7049]</a>) or extended
   diagnostic notation (Appendix G of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8610" title="&quot;Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL): A Notational Convention to Express Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and JSON Data Structures&quot;">RFC8610</a>]) also does not provide
   for unadorned CBOR Sequences at this time (the latter does provide
   for CBOR Sequences embedded in a byte string as per <a href="/doc/html/rfc8610#appendix-G.3">Appendix&nbsp;G.3 of
   [RFC8610]</a>).

   In a similar spirit to the recommendation for CDDL above, this
   specification recommends enclosing the CBOR data items in an array.
   In a more informal setting, where the boundaries within which the
   notation is used are obvious, it is also possible to leave off the
   outer brackets for this array, as shown in these two examples:

   [1, 2, 3]

   1, 2, 3

   Note that it is somewhat difficult to discuss zero-length CBOR
   Sequences in the latter form.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Optimizing CBOR Sequences for Skipping Elements</span>

   In certain applications, being able to efficiently skip an element
   without the need for decoding its substructure, or efficiently
   fanning out elements to multi-threaded decoding processes, is of the
   utmost importance.  For these applications, byte strings (which carry
   length information in bytes) containing embedded CBOR can be used as
   the elements of a CBOR Sequence:

   ; This defines an array of CBOR byte strings, the elements of which
   ; are to be used in a CBOR Sequence:
   my-sequence = [* my-element]
   my-element = bytes .cbor my-element-structure
   my-element-structure = my-foo / my-bar

   Within limits, this may also enable recovering from elements that
   internally are not well formed; the limitation is that the sequence
   of byte strings does need to be well formed as such.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations of CBOR [<a href="/doc/html/rfc7049" title="&quot;Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&quot;">RFC7049</a>] apply.  This format
   provides no cryptographic integrity protection of any kind but can be
   combined with security specifications such as CBOR Object Signing and
   Encryption (COSE) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8152" title="&quot;CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)&quot;">RFC8152</a>] to do so.  (COSE protections can be
   applied to an entire CBOR Sequence or to each of the elements of the
   sequence independently; in the latter case, additional effort may be
   required if there is a need to protect the relationship of the

   As usual, decoders must operate on input that is assumed to be
   untrusted.  This means that decoders MUST fail gracefully in the face
   of malicious inputs.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  CoAP Content-Format Registration</span>

   IANA has assigned a CoAP Content-Format ID for the media type
   &quot;application/cbor-seq&quot;, within the &quot;CoAP Content-Formats&quot; subregistry
   of the &quot;Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters&quot; registry
   [<a href="#ref-IANA-CORE-PARAMETERS">IANA-CORE-PARAMETERS</a>], from the &quot;Expert Review&quot; (0-255) range
   ([<a href="/doc/html/rfc8126" title="">RFC8126</a>]).  The assigned ID is shown in Table 1.

           +----------------------+----------+----+-----------+
           | Media type           | Encoding | ID | Reference |
           +======================+==========+====+===========+

   Structured Syntax Suffixes are registered within the &quot;Structured
   Syntax Suffix Registry&quot; maintained at
   [<a href="#ref-IANA-STRUCTURED-SYNTAX-SUFFIX">IANA-STRUCTURED-SYNTAX-SUFFIX</a>].  IANA has registered the &quot;+cbor-seq&quot;
   structured syntax suffix in accordance with [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6838" title="&quot;Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures&quot;">RFC6838</a>] as follows:

      Name: CBOR Sequence

      +suffix: +cbor-seq

      References: <a href="/doc/html/rfc8742">RFC 8742</a>

      Encoding considerations: binary

      Fragment identifier considerations: The syntax and semantics of
      fragment identifiers specified for +cbor-seq SHOULD be the same as
      that specified for &quot;application/cbor-seq&quot;.  (At the time of
      publication of this document, there is no fragment identification
      syntax defined for &quot;application/cbor-seq&quot;.)

         The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a
         specific &quot;xxx/yyy+cbor-seq&quot; SHOULD be processed as follows:

         o  For cases defined in +cbor-seq, if the fragment identifier
            resolves per the +cbor-seq rules, then process as specified
            in +cbor-seq.

         o  For cases defined in +cbor-seq, if the fragment identifier
            does not resolve per the +cbor-seq rules, then process as
            specified in &quot;xxx/yyy+cbor-seq&quot;.

         o  For cases not defined in +cbor-seq, process as specified in
            &quot;xxx/yyy+cbor-seq&quot;.

      Interoperability considerations: n/a
