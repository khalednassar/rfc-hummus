Sliding Window Random Linear Code (RLC) Forward Erasure Correction (FEC)
                          Schemes for FECFRAME

Abstract

   This document describes two fully specified Forward Erasure
   Correction (FEC) Schemes for Sliding Window Random Linear Codes
   (RLC), one for RLC over the Galois Field (a.k.a., Finite Field)
   GF(2), a second one for RLC over the Galois Field GF(2^(8)), each
   time with the possibility of controlling the code density.  They can
   protect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME
   extended to Sliding Window FEC Codes.  These Sliding Window FEC Codes
   rely on an encoding window that slides over the source symbols,
   generating new repair symbols whenever needed.  Compared to block FEC
   codes, these Sliding Window FEC Codes offer key advantages with real-
   time flows in terms of reduced FEC-related latency while often
   providing improved packet erasure recovery capabilities.

   Application-Level Forward Erasure Correction (AL-FEC) codes, or
   simply FEC codes, are a key element of communication systems.  They
   are used to recover from packet losses (or erasures) during content
   delivery sessions to a potentially large number of receivers
   (multicast/broadcast transmissions).  This is the case with the File
   Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE)/Asynchronous Layered
   Coding (ALC) protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6726" title="&quot;FLUTE - File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport&quot;">RFC6726</a>] when used for reliable file transfers
   over lossy networks, and the FECFRAME protocol [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6363" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6363</a>] when used
   for reliable continuous media transfers over lossy networks.

   The present document only focuses on the FECFRAME protocol, which is
   used in multicast/broadcast delivery mode, particularly for content
   that features stringent real-time constraints: each source packet has
   a maximum validity period after which it will not be considered by
   the destination application.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Limits of Block Codes with Real-Time Flows</span>

   With FECFRAME, there is a single FEC encoding point (either an end
   host/server (source) or a middlebox) and a single FEC decoding point
   per receiver (either an end host (receiver) or middlebox).  In this
   context, currently standardized AL-FEC codes for FECFRAME like Reed-
   Solomon [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6865" title="&quot;Simple Reed-Solomon Forward Error Correction (FEC) Scheme for FECFRAME&quot;">RFC6865</a>], LDPC-Staircase [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6816" title="&quot;Simple Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) Staircase Forward Error Correction (FEC) Scheme for FECFRAME&quot;">RFC6816</a>], or Raptor/RaptorQ
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6681" title="&quot;Raptor Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes for FECFRAME&quot;">RFC6681</a>], are all linear block codes: they require the data flow to
   be segmented into blocks of a predefined maximum size.

   To define this block size, it is required to find an appropriate
   balance between robustness and decoding latency: the larger the block
   size, the higher the robustness (e.g., in case of long packet erasure
   bursts), but also the higher the maximum decoding latency (i.e., the
   maximum time required to recover a lost (erased) packet thanks to FEC
   protection).  Therefore, with a multicast/broadcast session where
   different receivers experience different packet loss rates, the block
   size should be chosen by considering the worst communication
   conditions one wants to support, but without exceeding the desired
   maximum decoding latency.  This choice then impacts the FEC-related
   latency of all receivers, even those experiencing a good
   communication quality, since no FEC encoding can happen until all the
   source data of the block is available at the sender, which directly
   depends on the block size.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Lower Latency and Better Protection of Real-Time Flows with the</span>
<span class="h3">      Sliding Window RLC Codes</span>

   This document introduces two fully specified FEC schemes that do not
   follow the block code approach: the Sliding Window Random Linear
   Codes (RLC) over either Galois Fields (a.k.a., Finite Fields) GF(2)
   (the &quot;binary case&quot;) or GF(2^(8)), each time with the possibility of
   controlling the code density.  These FEC schemes are used to protect
   arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME extended
   to Sliding Window FEC Codes [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8680" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework Extension to Sliding Window Codes&quot;">RFC8680</a>].  These FEC schemes and, more
   generally, Sliding Window FEC Codes are recommended, for instance,
   with media that feature real-time constraints sent within a
   multicast/broadcast session [<a href="#ref-Roca17" title="&quot;Less Latency and Better Protection with AL-FEC Sliding Window Codes: a Robust Multimedia CBR Broadcast Case Study&quot;">Roca17</a>].

   The RLC codes belong to the broad class of Sliding Window AL-FEC
   Codes (a.k.a., convolutional codes) [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8406" title="&quot;Taxonomy of Coding Techniques for Efficient Network Communications&quot;">RFC8406</a>].  The encoding process
   is based on an encoding window that slides over the set of source
   packets (in fact source symbols as we will see in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>), this
   window being either of fixed size or variable size (a.k.a., an
   elastic window).  Repair symbols are generated on-the-fly, by
   computing a random linear combination of the source symbols present
   in the current encoding window, and passed to the transport layer.

   At the receiver, a linear system is managed from the set of received
   source and repair packets.  New variables (representing source
   symbols) and equations (representing the linear combination carried
   by each repair symbol received) are added upon receiving new packets.
   Variables and the equations they are involved in are removed when
   they are too old with respect to their validity period (real-time
   constraints).  Lost source symbols are then recovered thanks to this
   linear system whenever its rank permits to solve it (at least
   partially).

   The protection of any multicast/broadcast session needs to be
   dimensioned by considering the worst communication conditions one
   wants to support.  This is also true with RLC (more generally, any
   sliding window) code.  However, the receivers experiencing a good to
   medium communication quality will observe a reduced FEC-related
   latency compared to block codes [<a href="#ref-Roca17" title="&quot;Less Latency and Better Protection with AL-FEC Sliding Window Codes: a Robust Multimedia CBR Broadcast Case Study&quot;">Roca17</a>] since an isolated lost
   source packet is quickly recovered with the following repair packet.
   On the opposite, with a block code, recovering an isolated lost
   source packet always requires waiting for the first repair packet to
   arrive after the end of the block.  Additionally, under certain
   situations (e.g., with a limited FEC-related latency budget and with
   constant bitrate transmissions after FECFRAME encoding), Sliding
   Window Codes can more efficiently achieve a target transmission
   quality (e.g., measured by the residual loss after FEC decoding) by
   sending fewer repair packets (i.e., higher code rate) than block
   codes.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.3" href="#section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Small Transmission Overheads with the Sliding Window RLC FEC</span>
<span class="h3">      Scheme</span>

   The Sliding Window RLC FEC scheme is designed to limit the packet
   header overhead.  The main requirement is that each repair packet
   header must enable a receiver to reconstruct the set of source
   symbols plus the associated coefficients used during the encoding
   process.  In order to minimize packet overhead, the set of source
   symbols in the encoding window as well as the set of coefficients
   over GF(2^(m)) (where m is 1 or 8, depending on the FEC scheme) used
   in the linear combination are not individually listed in the repair
   packet header.  Instead, each FEC Repair Packet header contains:

   *  the Encoding Symbol Identifier (ESI) of the first source symbol in
      the encoding window as well as the number of symbols (since this
      number may vary with a variable size, elastic window).  These two
      pieces of information enable each receiver to reconstruct the set
      of source symbols considered during encoding, the only constraint
      being that there cannot be any gap;

   *  the seed and density threshold parameters used by a coding
      coefficients generation function (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>).  These two pieces
      of information enable each receiver to generate the same set of
      coding coefficients over GF(2^(m)) as the sender;

   Therefore, no matter the number of source symbols present in the
   encoding window, each FEC Repair Packet features a fixed 64-bit long
   header, called Repair FEC Payload ID (Figure 8).  Similarly, each FEC
   Source Packet features a fixed 32-bit long trailer, called Explicit
   Source FEC Payload ID (Figure 6), that contains the ESI of the first
   source symbol (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Common Procedures</span>

   This section introduces the procedures that are used by these FEC
   schemes.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Codec Parameters</span>

   A codec implementing the Sliding Window RLC FEC scheme relies on
   several parameters:

   Maximum FEC-related latency budget, max_lat (a decimal number
   expressed in seconds) with real-time flows:
      a source ADU flow can have real-time constraints, and therefore
      any FECFRAME related operation should take place within the
      validity period of each ADU (Appendix D describes an exception to
      this rule).  When there are multiple flows with different real-
      time constraints, we consider the most stringent constraints (see
      item 6 in <a href="/doc/html/rfc6363#section-10.2">Section&nbsp;10.2 of [RFC6363]</a>, for recommendations when
      several flows are globally protected).  The maximum FEC-related
      latency budget, max_lat, accounts for all sources of latency added
      by FEC encoding (at a sender) and FEC decoding (at a receiver).
      Other sources of latency (e.g., added by network communications)
      are out of scope and must be considered separately (said
      differently, they have already been deducted from max_lat).
      max_lat can be regarded as the latency budget permitted for all
      FEC-related operations.  This is an input parameter that enables a
      FECFRAME sender to derive other internal parameters (see
      <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>);

   Encoding window current (resp. maximum) size, ew_size (resp.
   ew_max_size) (in symbols):
      at a FECFRAME sender, during FEC encoding, a repair symbol is
      computed as a linear combination of the ew_size source symbols
      present in the encoding window.  The ew_max_size is the maximum
      size of this window, while ew_size is the current size.  For
      example, in the common case at session start, upon receiving new
      source ADUs, the ew_size progressively increases until it reaches
      its maximum value, ew_max_size.  We have:

         0 &lt; ew_size &lt;= ew_max_size

   Decoding window maximum size, dw_max_size (in symbols):
      at a FECFRAME receiver, dw_max_size is the maximum number of
      received or lost source symbols that are still within their
      latency budget;

   Linear system maximum size, ls_max_size (in symbols):
      at a FECFRAME receiver, the linear system maximum size,
      ls_max_size, is the maximum number of received or lost source
      symbols in the linear system (i.e., the variables).  It SHOULD NOT
      be smaller than dw_max_size since it would mean that, even after
      receiving a sufficient number of FEC Repair Packets, a lost ADU
      may not be recovered just because the associated source symbols
      have been prematurely removed from the linear system, which is
      usually counter-productive.  On the opposite, the linear system
      MAY grow beyond the dw_max_size (Appendix D);

   Symbol size, E (in bytes):
      the E parameter determines the source and repair symbol sizes
      (necessarily equal).  This is an input parameter that enables a
      FECFRAME sender to derive other internal parameters, as explained
      below.  An implementation at a sender MUST fix the E parameter and
      MUST communicate it as part of the FEC Scheme-Specific Information
      (<a href="#section-4.1.1.2">Section 4.1.1.2</a>).

   Code rate, cr:
      The code rate parameter determines the amount of redundancy added
      to the flow.  More precisely the cr is the ratio between the total
      number of source symbols and the total number of source plus
      repair symbols and by definition: 0 &lt; cr &lt;= 1.  This is an input
      parameter that enables a FECFRAME sender to derive other internal
      parameters, as explained below.  However, there is no need to
      communicate the cr parameter per see (it&#x27;s not required to process
      a repair symbol at a receiver).  This code rate parameter can be
      static.  However, in specific use-cases (e.g., with unicast
      transmissions in presence of a feedback mechanism that estimates
      the communication quality, out of scope of FECFRAME), the code
      rate may be adjusted dynamically.

   <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a> proposes non-normative techniques to derive those
   parameters, depending on the use-case specificities.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  ADU, ADUI, and Source Symbols Mappings</span>

   At a sender, an ADU coming from the application is not directly
   mapped to source symbols.  When multiple source flows (e.g., media
   streams) are mapped onto the same FECFRAME instance, each flow is
   assigned its own Flow ID value (see below).  This Flow ID is then
   prepended to each ADU before FEC encoding.  This way, FEC decoding at
   a receiver also recovers this Flow ID and the recovered ADU can be
   assigned to the right source flow (note that the 5-tuple used to
   identify the right source flow of a received ADU is absent with a
   recovered ADU since it is not FEC protected).

   Additionally, since ADUs are of variable size, padding is needed so
   that each ADU (with its flow identifier) contribute to an integral
   number of source symbols.  This requires adding the original ADU
   length to each ADU before doing FEC encoding.  Because of these
   requirements, an intermediate format, the ADUI, or ADU Information,
   is considered [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6363" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6363</a>].

   For each incoming ADU, an ADUI MUST be created as follows.  First of
   all, 3 bytes are prepended (Figure 1):

   Flow ID (F) (8-bit field):  this unsigned byte contains the integer
      identifier associated to the source ADU flow to which this ADU
      belongs.  It is assumed that a single byte is sufficient, which
      implies that no more than 256 flows will be protected by a single
      FECFRAME session instance.

   Length (L) (16-bit field):  this unsigned integer contains the length
      of this ADU, in network byte order (i.e., big endian).  This
      length is for the ADU itself and does not include the F, L, or Pad
      fields.

   Then, zero padding is added to the ADU if needed:

   Padding (Pad) (variable size field):  this field contains zero
      padding to align the F, L, ADU and padding up to a size that is
      multiple of E bytes (i.e., the source and repair symbol length).

   The data unit resulting from the ADU and the F, L, and Pad fields is
   called ADUI.  Since ADUs can have different sizes, this is also the
   case for ADUIs.  However, an ADUI always contributes to an integral
   number of source symbols.

      symbol length, E              E                     E
   &lt; ------------------ &gt;&lt; ------------------ &gt;&lt; ------------------ &gt;
   +-+--+---------------------------------------------+-------------+
   |F| L|                     ADU                     |     Pad     |
   +-+--+---------------------------------------------+-------------+

     Figure 1: ADUI Creation Example, Resulting in Three Source Symbols

   Note that neither the initial 3 bytes nor the optional padding are
   sent over the network.  However, they are considered during FEC
   encoding, and a receiver that lost a certain FEC Source Packet (e.g.,
   the UDP datagram containing this FEC Source Packet when UDP is used
   as the transport protocol) will be able to recover the ADUI if FEC
   decoding succeeds.  Thanks to the initial 3 bytes, this receiver will
   get rid of the padding (if any) and identify the corresponding ADU
   flow.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Encoding Window Management</span>

   Source symbols and the corresponding ADUs are removed from the
   encoding window:

   *  when the sliding encoding window has reached its maximum size,
      ew_max_size.  In that case the oldest symbol MUST be removed
      before adding a new symbol, so that the current encoding window
      size always remains inferior or equal to the maximum size: ew_size
      &lt;= ew_max_size;

   *  when an ADU has reached its maximum validity duration in case of a
      real-time flow.  When this happens, all source symbols
      corresponding to the ADUI that expired SHOULD be removed from the
      encoding window;

   Source symbols are added to the sliding encoding window each time a
   new ADU arrives, once the ADU-to-source symbols mapping has been
   performed (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).  The current size of the encoding window,
   ew_size, is updated after adding new source symbols.  This process
   may require to remove old source symbols so that: ew_size &lt;=
   ew_max_size.

   Note that a FEC codec may feature practical limits in the number of
   source symbols in the encoding window (e.g., for computational
   complexity reasons).  This factor may further limit the ew_max_size
   value, in addition to the maximum FEC-related latency budget
   (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Source Symbol Identification</span>

   Each source symbol is identified by an Encoding Symbol ID (ESI), an
   unsigned integer.  The ESI of source symbols MUST start with value 0
   for the first source symbol and MUST be managed sequentially.
   Wrapping to zero happens after reaching the maximum value made
   possible by the ESI field size (this maximum value is FEC scheme
   dependent, for instance, 2^(32)-1 with FEC schemes 9 and 10).

   No such consideration applies to repair symbols.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)</span>

   In order to compute coding coefficients (see <a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>), the RLC
   FEC schemes rely on the TinyMT32 PRNG defined in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8682" title="&quot;TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)&quot;">RFC8682</a>] with two
   additional functions defined in this section.

   This PRNG MUST first be initialized with a 32-bit unsigned integer,
   used as a seed, with:

      void   tinymt32_init (tinymt32_t * s, uint32_t seed);

   With the FEC schemes defined in this document, the seed is in
   practice restricted to a value between 0 and 0xFFFF inclusive (note
   that this PRNG accepts a seed value equal to 0), since this is the
   Repair_Key 16-bit field value of the Repair FEC Payload ID
   (<a href="#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3</a>).  In practice, how to manage the seed and Repair_Key
   values (both are equal) is left to the implementer, using a
   monotonically increasing counter being one possibility (<a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>).
   In addition to the seed, this function takes as parameter a pointer
   to an instance of a tinymt32_t structure that is used to keep the
   internal state of the PRNG.

   Then, each time a new pseudorandom integer between 0 and 15 inclusive
   (4-bit pseudorandom integer) is needed, the following function is
   used:

      uint32_t   tinymt32_rand16 (tinymt32_t * s);

   This function takes as parameter a pointer to the same tinymt32_t
   structure (that is left unchanged between successive calls to the
   function).

   Similarly, each time a new pseudorandom integer between 0 and 255
   inclusive (8-bit pseudorandom integer) is needed, the following
   function is used:

      uint32_t   tinymt32_rand256 (tinymt32_t * s);

   These two functions keep respectively the 4 or 8 less significant
   bits of the 32-bit pseudorandom number generated by the
   tinymt32_generate_uint32() function of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8682" title="&quot;TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)&quot;">RFC8682</a>].  This is done by
   computing the result of a binary AND between the
   tinymt32_generate_uint32() output and respectively the 0xF or 0xFF
   constants, using 32-bit unsigned integer operations.  Figure 2 shows
   a possible implementation.  This is a C language implementation,
   written for C99 [<a href="#ref-C99" title="&quot;Programming languages - C: C99, correction 3:2007&quot;">C99</a>].  Test results discussed in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> show
   that this simple technique, applied to this PRNG, is in line with the
   RLC FEC schemes needs.

          Figure 2: 4-bit and 8-bit Mapping Functions for TinyMT32

   Any implementation of this PRNG MUST have the same output as that
   provided by the reference implementation of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8682" title="&quot;TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)&quot;">RFC8682</a>].  In order to
   increase the compliance confidence, three criteria are proposed: the
   one described in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc8682" title="&quot;TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)&quot;">RFC8682</a>] (for the TinyMT32 32-bit unsigned integer
   generator), and the two others detailed in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> (for the
   mapping to 4-bit and 8-bit intervals).  Because of the way the
   mapping functions work, it is unlikely that an implementation that
   fulfills the first criterion fails to fulfill the two others.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.6" href="#section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Coding Coefficients Generation Function</span>

   The coding coefficients used during the encoding process are
   generated at the RLC encoder by the generate_coding_coefficients()
   function each time a new repair symbol needs to be produced.  The
   fraction of coefficients that are nonzero (i.e., the density) is
   controlled by the DT (Density Threshold) parameter.  DT has values
   between 0 (the minimum value) and 15 (the maximum value), and the
   average probability of having a nonzero coefficient equals (DT + 1) /
   16.  In particular, when DT equals 15 the function guaranties that
   all coefficients are nonzero (i.e., maximum density).

   These considerations apply to both the RLC over GF(2) and RLC over
   GF(2^(8)), the only difference being the value of the m parameter.
   With the RLC over GF(2) FEC scheme (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), m is equal to 1.
   With RLC over GF(2^(8)) FEC scheme (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>), m is equal to 8.

   Figure 3 shows the reference generate_coding_coefficients()
   implementation.  This is a C language implementation, written for C99
   [<a href="#ref-C99" title="&quot;Programming languages - C: C99, correction 3:2007&quot;">C99</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.7.1" href="#section-3.7.1">3.7.1</a>.  Finite Field Definitions</span>

   The two RLC FEC schemes specified in this document reuse the Finite
   Fields defined in <a href="/doc/html/rfc5510#section-8.1">[RFC5510], Section&nbsp;8.1</a>.  More specifically, the
   elements of the field GF(2^(m)) are represented by polynomials with
   binary coefficients (i.e., over GF(2)) and degree lower or equal to
   m-1.  The addition between two elements is defined as the addition of
   binary polynomials in GF(2), which is equivalent to a bitwise XOR
   operation on the binary representation of these elements.

   With GF(2^(8)), multiplication between two elements is the
   multiplication modulo a given irreducible polynomial of degree 8.
   The following irreducible polynomial is used for GF(2^(8)):

      x^(8) + x^(4) + x^(3) + x^(2) + 1

   With GF(2), multiplication corresponds to a logical AND operation.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.7.2" href="#section-3.7.2">3.7.2</a>.  Linear Combination of Source Symbol Computation</span>

   The two RLC FEC schemes require the computation of a linear
   combination of source symbols, using the coding coefficients produced
   by the generate_coding_coefficients() function and stored in the
   cc_tab[] array.

   With the RLC over GF(2^(8)) FEC scheme, a linear combination of the
   ew_size source symbol present in the encoding window, say src_0 to
   src_ew_size_1, in order to generate a repair symbol, is computed as
   follows.  For each byte of position i in each source and the repair
   symbol, where i belongs to [0; E-1], compute:

      repair[i] = cc_tab[0] * src_0[i] XOR cc_tab[1] * src_1[i] XOR ...
      XOR cc_tab[ew_size - 1] * src_ew_size_1[i]

   where * is the multiplication over GF(2^(8)).  In practice various
   optimizations need to be used in order to make this computation
   efficient (see in particular [<a href="#ref-PGM13" title="&quot;A Complete Treatment of Software Implementations of Finite Field Arithmetic for Erasure Coding Applications&quot;">PGM13</a>]).

   With the RLC over GF(2) FEC scheme (binary case), a linear
   combination is computed as follows.  The repair symbol is the XOR sum
   of all the source symbols corresponding to a coding coefficient
   cc_tab[j] equal to 1 (i.e., the source symbols corresponding to zero
   coding coefficients are ignored).  The XOR sum of the byte of
   position i in each source is computed and stored in the corresponding
   byte of the repair symbol, where i belongs to [0; E-1].  In practice,
   the XOR sums will be computed several bytes at a time (e.g., on 64
   bit words, or on arrays of 16 or more bytes when using SIMD CPU
   extensions).

   With both FEC schemes, the details of how to optimize the computation
   of these linear combinations are of high practical importance but out
   of scope of this document.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  FEC Framework Configuration Information</span>

   Following the guidelines of <a href="/doc/html/rfc6363#section-5.6">Section&nbsp;5.6 of [RFC6363]</a>, this section
   provides the FEC Framework Configuration Information (or FFCI).  This
   FCCI needs to be shared (e.g., using SDP) between the FECFRAME sender
   and receiver instances in order to synchronize them.  It includes a
   FEC Encoding ID, mandatory for any FEC scheme specification, plus
   scheme-specific elements.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1.1">4.1.1.1</a>.  FEC Encoding ID</span>

   FEC Encoding ID:  the value assigned to this fully specified FEC
      scheme MUST be 10, as assigned by IANA (<a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>).

   When SDP is used to communicate the FFCI, this FEC Encoding ID is
   carried in the &#x27;encoding-id&#x27; parameter.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1.1.2" href="#section-4.1.1.2">4.1.1.2</a>.  FEC Scheme-Specific Information</span>

   The FEC Scheme-Specific Information (FSSI) includes elements that are
   specific to the present FEC scheme.  More precisely:

   Encoding symbol size (E):  a non-negative integer that indicates the
      size of each encoding symbol in bytes;

   Window Size Ratio (WSR) parameter:  a non-negative integer between 0
      and 255 (both inclusive) used to initialize window sizes.  A value
      of 0 indicates this parameter is not considered (e.g., a fixed
      encoding window size may be chosen).  A value between 1 and 255
      inclusive is required by certain of the parameter derivation
      techniques described in <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>;

   This element is required both by the sender (RLC encoder) and the
   receiver(s) (RLC decoder).

   When SDP is used to communicate the FFCI, this FEC Scheme-Specific
   Information is carried in the &#x27;fssi&#x27; parameter in textual
   representation as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6364" title="&quot;Session Description Protocol Elements for the Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6364</a>].  For instance:

      fssi=E:1400,WSR:191

   In that case the name values &quot;E&quot; and &quot;WSR&quot; are used to convey the E
   and WSR parameters respectively.

   If another mechanism requires the FSSI to be carried as an opaque
   octet string, the encoding format consists of the following three
   octets, where the E field is carried in &quot;big-endian&quot; or &quot;network
   order&quot; format, that is, most significant byte first:

      Encoding symbol length (E): 16-bit field;

      Window Size Ratio Parameter (WSR): 8-bit field.

   These three octets can be communicated as such, or for instance, be
   subject to an additional Base64 encoding.

   A FEC Repair Packet MAY contain one or more repair symbols.  When

   generated from the same encoding window, using Repair_Key values that
   are managed as explained below.  A receiver can easily deduce the
   number of repair symbols within a FEC Repair Packet by comparing the
   received FEC Repair Packet size (equal to the UDP payload size when
   UDP is the underlying transport protocol) and the symbol size, E,
   communicated in the FFCI.

   A FEC Repair Packet MUST contain a Repair FEC Payload ID that is
   prepended to the repair symbol as illustrated in Figure 7.

                                 Payload ID

   More precisely, the Repair FEC Payload ID is composed of the
   following fields where all integer fields are carried in &quot;big-endian&quot;
   or &quot;network order&quot; format, that is, most significant byte first
   (Figure 8):

   Repair_Key (16-bit field):  this unsigned integer is used as a seed
      by the coefficient generation function (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>) in order to
      generate the desired number of coding coefficients.  This repair
      key may be a monotonically increasing integer value that loops
      back to 0 after reaching 65535 (see <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>).  When a FEC
      Repair Packet contains several repair symbols, this repair key
      value is that of the first repair symbol.  The remaining repair
      keys can be deduced by incrementing by 1 this value, up to a
      maximum value of 65535 after which it loops back to 0.

   Density Threshold for the coding coefficients, DT (4-bit field):
      this unsigned integer carries the Density Threshold (DT) used by
      the coding coefficient generation function <a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>.  More
      precisely, it controls the probability of having a nonzero coding
      coefficient, which equals (DT+1) / 16.  When a FEC Repair Packet
      contains several repair symbols, the DT value applies to all of
      them;

   Number of Source Symbols in the encoding window, NSS (12-bit
   field):
      this unsigned integer indicates the number of source symbols in
      the encoding window when this repair symbol was generated.  When a
      FEC Repair Packet contains several repair symbols, this NSS value
      applies to all of them;

   ESI of First Source Symbol in the encoding window, FSS_ESI (32-bit
   field):
      this unsigned integer indicates the ESI of the first source symbol
      in the encoding window when this repair symbol was generated.
      When a FEC Repair Packet contains several repair symbols, this
      FSS_ESI value applies to all of them;

   This section provides a high level description of a Sliding Window
   RLC encoder.

   Whenever a new FEC Repair Packet is needed, the RLC encoder instance
   first gathers the ew_size source symbols currently in the sliding
   encoding window.  Then it chooses a repair key, which can be a
   monotonically increasing integer value, incremented for each repair
   symbol up to a maximum value of 65535 (as it is carried within a
   16-bit field) after which it loops back to 0.  This repair key is
   communicated to the coefficient generation function (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>) in
   order to generate ew_size coding coefficients.  Finally, the FECFRAME
   sender computes the repair symbol as a linear combination of the
   ew_size source symbols using the ew_size coding coefficients
   (<a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>).  When E is small and when there is an incentive to
   pack several repair symbols within the same FEC Repair Packet, the
   appropriate number of repair symbols are computed.  In that case the
   repair key for each of them MUST be incremented by 1, keeping the
   same ew_size source symbols, since only the first repair key will be
   carried in the Repair FEC Payload ID.  The FEC Repair Packet can then
   be passed to the transport layer for transmission.  The source versus
   repair FEC packet transmission order is out of scope of this document
   and several approaches exist that are implementation-specific.

   Other solutions are possible to select a repair key value when a new
   FEC Repair Packet is needed, for instance, by choosing a random
   integer between 0 and 65535.  However, selecting the same repair key
   as before (which may happen in case of a random process) is only
   meaningful if the encoding window has changed, otherwise the same FEC
   Repair Packet will be generated.  In any case, choosing the repair
   key is entirely at the discretion of the sender, since it is
   communicated to the receiver(s) in each Repair FEC Payload ID.  A
   receiver should not make any assumption on the way the repair key is
   managed.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Decoding Side</span>

   This section provides a high level description of a Sliding Window
   RLC decoder.

   A FECFRAME receiver needs to maintain a linear system whose variables
   are the received and lost source symbols.  Upon receiving a FEC
   Repair Packet, a receiver first extracts all the repair symbols it
   contains (in case several repair symbols are packed together).  For
   each repair symbol, when at least one of the corresponding source
   symbols it protects has been lost, the receiver adds an equation to
   the linear system (or no equation if this repair packet does not
   change the linear system rank).  This equation of course re-uses the
   ew_size coding coefficients that are computed by the same coefficient
   generation function (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>), using the repair key and encoding
   window descriptions carried in the Repair FEC Payload ID.  Whenever
   possible (i.e., when a sub-system covering one or more lost source
   symbols is of full rank), decoding is performed in order to recover
   lost source symbols.  Gaussian elimination is one possible algorithm
   to solve this linear system.  Each time an ADUI can be totally
   recovered, padding is removed (thanks to the Length field, L, of the
   ADUI) and the ADU is assigned to the corresponding application flow
   (thanks to the Flow ID field, F, of the ADUI).  This ADU is finally
   passed to the corresponding upper application.  Received FEC Source
   Packets, containing an ADU, MAY be passed to the application either
   immediately or after some time to guaranty an ordered delivery to the
   application.  This document does not mandate any approach as this is
   an operational and management decision.

   With real-time flows, a lost ADU that is decoded after the maximum
   latency or an ADU received after this delay has no value to the
   application.  This raises the question of deciding whether or not an
   ADU is late.  This decision MAY be taken within the FECFRAME receiver
   (e.g., using the decoding window, see <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) or within the
   application (e.g., using RTP timestamps within the ADU).  Deciding
   which option to follow and whether or not to pass all ADUs, including
   those assumed late, to the application are operational decisions that
   depend on the application and are therefore out of scope of this
   document.  Additionally, <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a> discusses a backward compatible
   optimization whereby late source symbols MAY still be used within the
   FECFRAME receiver in order to improve transmission robustness.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The FEC Framework document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6363" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6363</a>] provides a fairly comprehensive
   analysis of security considerations applicable to FEC schemes.
   Therefore, the present section follows the security considerations

   The Sliding Window RLC FEC scheme specified in this document does not

   on both the FEC Source and Repair Packets.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Attacks Against the FEC Parameters</span>

   The FEC scheme specified in this document defines parameters that can
   be the basis of attacks.  More specifically, the following parameters
   of the FFCI may be modified by an attacker who targets receivers
   (<a href="#section-4.1.1.2">Section 4.1.1.2</a>):

   FEC Encoding ID:  changing this parameter leads a receiver to
      consider a different FEC scheme.  The consequences are severe, the
      format of the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC
      Payload ID of received packets will probably differ, leading to
      various malfunctions.  Even if the original and modified FEC
      schemes share the same format, FEC decoding will either fail or
      lead to corrupted decoded symbols.  This will happen if an
      attacker turns value 9 (i.e., RLC over GF(2)) to value 10 (RLC
      over GF(2^(8))), an additional consequence being a higher
      processing overhead at the receiver.  In any case, the attack
      results in a form of Denial of Service (DoS) or corrupted content.

   Encoding symbol length (E):  setting this E parameter to a different
      value will confuse a receiver.  If the size of a received FEC
      Repair Packet is no longer multiple of the modified E value, a
      receiver quickly detects a problem and SHOULD reject the packet.
      If the new E value is a sub-multiple of the original E value
      (e.g., half the original value), then receivers may not detect the
      problem immediately.  For instance, a receiver may think that a
      received FEC Repair Packet contains more repair symbols (e.g.,
      twice as many if E is reduced by half), leading to malfunctions
      whose nature depends on implementation details.  Here also, the
      attack always results in a form of DoS or corrupted content.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to
   guarantee the FFCI integrity, as specified in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6363" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6363</a>].  How to
   achieve this depends on the way the FFCI is communicated from the
   sender to the receiver, which is not specified in this document.

   Similarly, attacks are possible against the Explicit Source FEC
   Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload ID.  More specifically, in case of
   a FEC Source Packet, the following value can be modified by an
   attacker who targets receivers:

   Encoding Symbol ID (ESI):  changing the ESI leads a receiver to
      consider a wrong ADU, resulting in severe consequences, including
      corrupted content passed to the receiving application;

   And in case of a FEC Repair Packet:

   Repair Key:  changing this value leads a receiver to generate a wrong
      coding coefficient sequence, and therefore any source symbol
      decoded using the repair symbols contained in this packet will be
      corrupted;

   DT:  changing this value also leads a receiver to generate a wrong
      coding coefficient sequence, and therefore any source symbol
      decoded using the repair symbols contained in this packet will be
      corrupted.  In addition, if the DT value is significantly
      increased, it will generate a higher processing overhead at a
      receiver.  In case of very large encoding windows, this may impact
      the terminal performance;

   NSS:  changing this value leads a receiver to consider a different
      set of source symbols, and therefore any source symbol decoded
      using the repair symbols contained in this packet will be
      corrupted.  In addition, if the NSS value is significantly
      increased, it will generate a higher processing overhead at a
      receiver, which may impact the terminal performance;

   FSS_ESI:  changing this value also leads a receiver to consider a
      different set of source symbols and therefore any source symbol
      decoded using the repair symbols contained in this packet will be
      corrupted.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures are taken to
   guarantee the FEC Source and Repair Packets as stated in [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6363" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6363</a>].

   In addition to the above security considerations, inherited from
   [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6363" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6363</a>], the present document introduces several formulae, in
   particular in <a href="#appendix-C.1">Appendix C.1</a>.  It is RECOMMENDED to check that the
   computed values stay within reasonable bounds since numerical
   overflows, caused by an erroneous implementation or an erroneous
   input value, may lead to hazardous behaviors.  However, what
   &quot;reasonable bounds&quot; means is use-case and implementation dependent
   and is not detailed in this document.

   <a href="#appendix-C.2">Appendix C.2</a> also mentions the possibility of &quot;using the timestamp
   field of an RTP packet header&quot; when applicable.  A malicious attacker
   may deliberately corrupt this header field in order to trigger
   hazardous behaviors at a FECFRAME receiver.  Protection against this
   type of content corruption can be addressed with the above
   recommendations on a baseline secure operation.  In addition, it is
   also RECOMMENDED to check that the timestamp value be within
   reasonable bounds.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Operations and Management Considerations</span>

   The FEC Framework document [<a href="/doc/html/rfc6363" title="&quot;Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework&quot;">RFC6363</a>] provides a fairly comprehensive
   analysis of operations and management considerations applicable to
   FEC schemes.  Therefore, the present section only discusses specific
   topics.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-8.1" href="#section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Operational Recommendations: Finite Field GF(2) Versus GF(2^(8))</span>

   The present document specifies two FEC schemes that differ on the
   Finite Field used for the coding coefficients.  It is expected that
   the RLC over GF(2^(8)) FEC scheme will be mostly used since it
   warrants a higher packet loss protection.  In case of small encoding
   windows, the associated processing overhead is not an issue (e.g., we
   measured decoding speeds between 745 Mbps and 2.8 Gbps on an ARM
   Cortex-A15 embedded board in [<a href="#ref-Roca17" title="&quot;Less Latency and Better Protection with AL-FEC Sliding Window Codes: a Robust Multimedia CBR Broadcast Case Study&quot;">Roca17</a>] depending on the code rate and
   the channel conditions, using an encoding window of size 18 or 23
   symbols; see the above article for the details).  Of course the CPU
   overhead will increase with the encoding window size, because more
   operations in the GF(2^(8)) finite field will be needed.

   The RLC over GF(2) FEC scheme offers an alternative.  In that case
   operations symbols can be directly XOR-ed together which warrants
   high bitrate encoding and decoding operations, and can be an
   advantage with large encoding windows.  However, packet loss
   protection is significantly reduced by using this FEC scheme.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-8.2" href="#section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Operational Recommendations: Coding Coefficients Density Threshold</span>

   In addition to the choice of the Finite Field, the two FEC schemes
   define a coding coefficient density threshold (DT) parameter.  This
   parameter enables a sender to control the code density, i.e., the
   proportion of coefficients that are nonzero on average.  With RLC
   over GF(2^(8)), it is usually appropriate that small encoding windows
   be associated to a density threshold equal to 15, the maximum value,
   in order to warrant a high loss protection.

   On the opposite, with larger encoding windows, it is usually
   appropriate that the density threshold be reduced.  With large
   encoding windows, an alternative can be to use RLC over GF(2) and a
   density threshold equal to 7 (i.e., an average density equal to 1/2)
   or smaller.

   Note that using a density threshold equal to 15 with RLC over GF(2)
   is equivalent to using an XOR code that computes the XOR sum of all
   the source symbols in the encoding window.  In that case: (1) only a
   single repair symbol can be produced for any encoding window, and (2)
   the repair_key parameter becomes useless (the coding coefficients
   generation function does not rely on the PRNG).

   PRNG determinism, for a given seed, is a requirement.  Consequently,
   in order to validate an implementation of the TinyMT32 PRNG, the
   following criteria MUST be met.

   The first criterion focuses on the tinymt32_rand256(), where the
   32-bit integer of the core TinyMT32 PRNG is scaled down to an 8-bit
   integer.  Using a seed value of 1, the first 50 values returned by:
   tinymt32_rand256() as 8-bit unsigned integers MUST be equal to values
   provided in Figure 9, to be read line by line.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-B" href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Assessing the PRNG Adequacy (Informational)</span>

   This annex discusses the adequacy of the TinyMT32 PRNG and the
   tinymt32_rand16() and tinymt32_rand256() functions, to the RLC FEC
   schemes.  The goal is to assess the adequacy of these two functions
   in producing coding coefficients that are sufficiently different from
   one another, across various repair symbols with repair key values in
   sequence (we can expect this approach to be commonly used by
   implementers, see <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>).  This section is purely informational
   and does not claim to be a solid evaluation.

   The two RLC FEC schemes use the PRNG to produce pseudorandom coding
   coefficients (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>), each time a new repair symbol is needed.
   A different repair key is used for each repair symbol, usually by
   incrementing the repair key value (<a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>).  For each repair
   symbol, a limited number of pseudorandom numbers is needed, depending
   on the DT and encoding window size (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>), using either
   tinymt32_rand16() or tinymt32_rand256().  Therefore, we are more
   interested in the randomness of small sequences of random numbers
   mapped to 4-bit or 8-bit integers, than in the randomness of a very
   large sequence of random numbers which is not representative of the
   usage of the PRNG.

   Evaluation of tinymt32_rand16(): We first generate a huge number
   (1,000,000,000) of small sequences (20 pseudorandom numbers per
   sequence), increasing the seed value for each sequence, and perform
   statistics on the number of occurrences of each of the 16 possible
   values across all sequences.  In this first test we consider 32-bit
   seed values in order to assess the PRNG quality after output

                          Occurrence Statistics

   Evaluation of tinymt32_rand16(): We first generate a huge number
   (1,000,000,000) of small sequences (20 pseudorandom numbers per
   sequence), increasing the seed value for each sequence, and perform
   statistics on the number of occurrences of each of the 16 possible
   values across the 20,000,000,000 numbers of all sequences.  In this
   first test, we consider 32-bit seed values in order to assess the
   PRNG quality after output truncation to 4 bits.

   The results (Table 1) show that all possible values are almost
   equally represented, or said differently, that the tinymt32_rand16()
   output converges to a uniform distribution where each of the 16
   possible values would appear exactly 1 / 16 * 100 = 6.25% of times.

   Since the RLC FEC schemes use of this PRNG will be limited to 16-bit
   seed values, we carried out the same test for the first 2^(16) seed
   values only.  The distribution (not shown) is of course less uniform,
   with value occurrences ranging between 6.2121% (i.e., 81,423
   occurrences out of a total of 65536*20=1,310,720) and 6.2948% (i.e.,
   82,507 occurrences).  However, we do not believe it significantly
   impacts the RLC FEC scheme behavior.

   Other types of biases may exist that may be visible with smaller
   tests, for instance to evaluate the convergence speed to a uniform
   distribution.  We therefore perform 200 tests, each of them producing
   200 sequences, keeping only the first value of each sequence.  We use
   non-overlapping repair keys for each sequence, starting with value 0
   and increasing it after each use.

              Table 2: tinymt32_rand16() Occurrence Statistics

   Table 2 shows across all 200 tests, for each of the 16 possible
   pseudorandom number values, the minimum (resp. maximum) number of
   times it appeared in a test, as well as the average number of
   occurrences across the 200 tests.  Although the distribution is not
   perfect, there is no major bias.  On the contrary, in the same
   conditions, the Park-Miller linear congruential PRNG of [<a href="/doc/html/rfc5170" title="&quot;Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Staircase and Triangle Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes&quot;">RFC5170</a>]
   with a result scaled down to 4-bit values, using seeds in sequence
   starting from 1, systematically returns 0 as the first value during
   some time.  Then, after a certain repair key value threshold, it
   systematically returns 1, etc.

   Evaluation of tinymt32_rand256(): The same approach is used here.
   Results (not shown) are similar: occurrences vary between 7,810,3368
   (i.e., 0.3905%) and 7,814,7952 (i.e., 0.3907%).  Here also we see a
   convergence to the theoretical uniform distribution where each of the
   256 possible values would appear exactly 1 / 256 * 100 = 0.390625% of
   times.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C" href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>.  Possible Parameter Derivation (Informational)</span>

   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> defines several parameters to control the encoder or
   decoder.  This annex proposes techniques to derive these parameters
   according to the target use-case.  This annex is informational, in
   the sense that using a different derivation technique will not
   prevent the encoder and decoder to interoperate: a decoder can still
   recover an erased source symbol without any error.  However, in case
   of a real-time flow, an inappropriate parameter derivation may lead
   to the decoding of erased source packets after their validity period,
   making them useless to the target application.  This annex proposes
   an approach to reduce this risk, among other things.

   The FEC schemes defined in this document can be used in various
   manners, depending on the target use-case:

   *  the source ADU flow they protect may or may not have real-time
      constraints;

   *  the source ADU flow may be a Constant Bitrate (CBR) or Variable
      Bitrate (VBR) flow;

   *  with a VBR source ADU flow, the flow&#x27;s minimum and maximum
      bitrates may or may not be known;

   *  and the communication path between encoder and decoder may be a
      CBR communication path (e.g., as with certain LTE-based broadcast
      channels) or not (general case, e.g., with Internet).

   The parameter derivation technique should be suited to the use-case,
   as described in the following sections.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C.1" href="#appendix-C.1">C.1</a>.  Case of a CBR Real-Time Flow</span>

   In the following, we consider a real-time flow with max_lat latency
   budget.  The encoding symbol size, E, is constant.  The code rate,
   cr, is also constant, its value depending on the expected
   communication loss model (this choice is out of scope of this
   document).

   In a first configuration, the source ADU flow bitrate at the input of
   the FECFRAME sender is fixed and equal to br_in (in bits/s), and this
   value is known by the FECFRAME sender.  It follows that the
   transmission bitrate at the output of the FECFRAME sender will be
   higher, depending on the added repair flow overhead.  In order to
   comply with the maximum FEC-related latency budget, we have:

      dw_max_size = (max_lat * br_in) / (8 * E)

   assuming that the encoding and decoding times are negligible with
   respect to the target max_lat.  This is a reasonable assumption in
   many situations (e.g., see <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a> in case of small window
   sizes).  Otherwise the max_lat parameter should be adjusted in order
   to avoid the problem.  In any case, interoperability will never be
   compromised by choosing a too large value.

   In a second configuration, the FECFRAME sender generates a fixed
   bitrate flow, equal to the CBR communication path bitrate equal to
   br_out (in bits/s), and this value is known by the FECFRAME sender,
   as in [<a href="#ref-Roca17" title="&quot;Less Latency and Better Protection with AL-FEC Sliding Window Codes: a Robust Multimedia CBR Broadcast Case Study&quot;">Roca17</a>].  The maximum source flow bitrate needs to be such
   that, with the added repair flow overhead, the total transmission
   bitrate remains inferior or equal to br_out.  We have:

      dw_max_size = (max_lat * br_out * cr) / (8 * E)

   assuming here also that the encoding and decoding times are
   negligible with respect to the target max_lat.

   For decoding to be possible within the latency budget, it is required
   that the encoding window maximum size be smaller than or at most
   equal to the decoding window maximum size.  The ew_max_size is the
   main parameter at a FECFRAME sender, but its exact value has no
   impact on the FEC-related latency budget.  The ew_max_size parameter
   is computed as follows:

      ew_max_size = dw_max_size * WSR / 255

   In line with [<a href="#ref-Roca17" title="&quot;Less Latency and Better Protection with AL-FEC Sliding Window Codes: a Robust Multimedia CBR Broadcast Case Study&quot;">Roca17</a>], WSR = 191 is considered as a reasonable value
   (the resulting encoding to decoding window size ratio is then close
   to 0.75), but other values between 1 and 255 inclusive are possible,
   depending on the use-case.

   The dw_max_size is computed by a FECFRAME sender but not explicitly
   communicated to a FECFRAME receiver.  However, a FECFRAME receiver
   can easily evaluate the ew_max_size by observing the maximum Number
   of Source Symbols (NSS) value contained in the Repair FEC Payload ID
   of received FEC Repair Packets (<a href="#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3</a>).  A receiver can then
   easily compute dw_max_size:

      dw_max_size = max_NSS_observed * 255 / WSR

   A receiver can then choose an appropriate linear system maximum size:

      ls_max_size &gt;= dw_max_size

   It is good practice to use a larger value for ls_max_size as
   explained in <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a>, which does not impact maximum latency nor
   interoperability.

   In any case, for a given use-case (i.e., for target encoding and
   decoding devices and desired protection levels in front of
   communication impairments) and for the computed ew_max_size,
   dw_max_size and ls_max_size values, it is RECOMMENDED to check that
   the maximum encoding time and maximum memory requirements at a
   FECFRAME sender, and maximum decoding time and maximum memory
   requirements at a FECFRAME receiver, stay within reasonable bounds.
   When assuming that the encoding and decoding times are negligible
   with respect to the target max_lat, this should be verified as well,
   otherwise the max_lat SHOULD be adjusted accordingly.

   The particular case of session start needs to be managed
   appropriately since the ew_size, starting at zero, increases each
   time a new source ADU is received by the FECFRAME sender, until it
   reaches the ew_max_size value.  Therefore, a FECFRAME receiver SHOULD
   continuously observe the received FEC Repair Packets, since the NSS
   value carried in the Repair FEC Payload ID will increase too, and
   adjust its ls_max_size accordingly if need be.  With a CBR flow,
   session start is expected to be the only moment when the encoding
   window size will increase.  Similarly, with a CBR real-time flow, the
   session end is expected to be the only moment when the encoding
   window size will progressively decrease.  No adjustment of the
   ls_max_size is required at the FECFRAME receiver in that case.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C.2" href="#appendix-C.2">C.2</a>.  Other Types of Real-Time Flow</span>

   In the following, we consider a real-time source ADU flow with a
   max_lat latency budget and a variable bitrate (VBR) measured at the
   entry of the FECFRAME sender.  A first approach consists in
   considering the smallest instantaneous bitrate of the source ADU
   flow, when this parameter is known, and to reuse the derivation of
   <a href="#appendix-C.1">Appendix C.1</a>.  Considering the smallest bitrate means that the
   encoding and decoding window maximum size estimations are
   pessimistic: these windows have the smallest size required to enable
   on-time decoding at a FECFRAME receiver.  If the instantaneous
   bitrate is higher than this smallest bitrate, this approach leads to
   an encoding window that is unnecessarily small, which reduces
   robustness in front of long erasure bursts.

   Another approach consists in using ADU timing information (e.g.,
   using the timestamp field of an RTP packet header, or registering the
   time upon receiving a new ADU).  From the global FEC-related latency
   budget, the FECFRAME sender can derive a practical maximum latency
   budget for encoding operations, max_lat_for_encoding.  For the FEC
   schemes specified in this document, this latency budget SHOULD be
   computed with:

      max_lat_for_encoding = max_lat * WSR / 255

   It follows that any source symbols associated to an ADU that has
   timed-out with respect to max_lat_for_encoding SHOULD be removed from
   the encoding window.  With this approach there is no pre-determined
   ew_size value: this value fluctuates over the time according to the
   instantaneous source ADU flow bitrate.  For practical reasons, a
   FECFRAME sender may still require that ew_size does not increase
   beyond a maximum value (Appendix C.3).

   With both approaches, and no matter the choice of the FECFRAME
   sender, a FECFRAME receiver can still easily evaluate the ew_max_size
   by observing the maximum Number of Source Symbols (NSS) value
   contained in the Repair FEC Payload ID of received FEC Repair
   Packets.  A receiver can then compute dw_max_size and derive an
   appropriate ls_max_size as explained in <a href="#appendix-C.1">Appendix C.1</a>.

   When the observed NSS fluctuates significantly, a FECFRAME receiver
   may want to adapt its ls_max_size accordingly.  In particular when
   the NSS is significantly reduced, a FECFRAME receiver may want to
   reduce the ls_max_size too in order to limit computation complexity.
   A balance must be found between using an ls_max_size &quot;too large&quot;
   (which increases computation complexity and memory requirements) and
   the opposite (which reduces recovery performance).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-C.3" href="#appendix-C.3">C.3</a>.  Case of a Non-Real-Time Flow</span>

   Finally there are configurations where a source ADU flow has no real-
   time constraints.  FECFRAME and the FEC schemes defined in this
   document can still be used.  The choice of appropriate parameter
   values can be directed by practical considerations.  For instance, it
   can derive from an estimation of the maximum memory amount that could
   be dedicated to the linear system at a FECFRAME receiver, or the
   maximum computation complexity at a FECFRAME receiver, both of them
   depending on the ls_max_size parameter.  The same considerations also
   apply to the FECFRAME sender, where the maximum memory amount and
   computation complexity depend on the ew_max_size parameter.

   Here also, the NSS value contained in FEC Repair Packets is used by a
   FECFRAME receiver to determine the current coding window size and
   ew_max_size by observing its maximum value over the time.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="appendix-D" href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a>.  Decoding Beyond Maximum Latency Optimization</span>
             (Informational)

   This annex introduces non-normative considerations.  It is provided
   as suggestions, without any impact on interoperability.  For more
   information see [<a href="#ref-Roca16" title="&quot;Block or Convolutional AL-FEC Codes? A Performance Comparison for Robust Low-Latency Communications&quot;">Roca16</a>].

   With a real-time source ADU flow, it is possible to improve the
   decoding performance of Sliding Window Codes without impacting
   maximum latency, at the cost of extra memory and CPU overhead.  The
   optimization consists, for a FECFRAME receiver, to extend the linear
   system beyond the decoding window maximum size, by keeping a certain
   number of old source symbols whereas their associated ADUs timed-out:

      ls_max_size &gt; dw_max_size

   Usually the following choice is a good trade-off between decoding
   performance and extra CPU overhead:

      ls_max_size = 2 * dw_max_size

   When the dw_max_size is very small, it may be preferable to keep a
   minimum ls_max_size value (e.g., LS_MIN_SIZE_DEFAULT = 40 symbols).
   Going below this threshold will not save a significant amount of
   memory nor CPU cycles.  Therefore:

      ls_max_size = max(2 * dw_max_size, LS_MIN_SIZE_DEFAULT)

   Finally, it is worth noting that a receiver that benefits from an FEC
   protection significantly higher than what is required to recover from
   packet losses, can choose to reduce the ls_max_size.  In that case
   lost ADUs will be recovered without relying on this optimization.

        Figure 11: Relationship between Parameters to Decode beyond

   It means that source symbols, and therefore ADUs, may be decoded even
   if the added latency exceeds the maximum value permitted by the
   application (the &quot;late source symbols&quot; of Figure 11).  It follows
   that the corresponding ADUs will not be useful to the application.
   However, decoding these &quot;late symbols&quot; significantly improves the
   global robustness in bad reception conditions and is therefore
   recommended for receivers experiencing bad communication conditions
   [<a href="#ref-Roca16" title="&quot;Block or Convolutional AL-FEC Codes? A Performance Comparison for Robust Low-Latency Communications&quot;">Roca16</a>].  In any case whether or not to use this optimization and
   what exact value to use for the ls_max_size parameter are local
   decisions made by each receiver independently, without any impact on
   the other receivers nor on the source.
