   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of extensions which instrument DNS
   name server functions.  This memo was produced by the DNS working
   group.

   With the adoption of the Internet-standard Network Management
   Framework [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets&quot;">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets&quot;">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6" title="&quot;Simple Network Management Protocol&quot;">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7" title="&quot;Concise MIB Definitions&quot;">7</a>], and with a large number of vendor
   implementations of these standards in commercially available
   products, it became possible to provide a higher level of effective
   network management in TCP/IP-based internets than was previously
   available.  With the growth in the use of these standards, it has
   become possible to consider the management of other elements of the
   infrastructure beyond the basic TCP/IP protocols.  A key element of

   the TCP/IP infrastructure is the DNS.

   Up to this point there has been no mechanism to integrate the
   management of the DNS with SNMP-based managers.  This memo provides
   the mechanisms by which IP-based management stations can effectively
   manage DNS name server software in an integrated fashion.

   We have defined DNS MIB objects to be used in conjunction with the
   Internet MIB to allow access to and control of DNS name server
   software via SNMP by the Internet community.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework</span>

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o  <a href="/doc/html/rfc1442">RFC 1442</a> which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
         describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      o  STD 17, <a href="/doc/html/rfc1213">RFC 1213</a> defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
         for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o  <a href="/doc/html/rfc1445">RFC 1445</a> which defines the administrative and other architectural
         aspects of the framework.

      o  <a href="/doc/html/rfc1448">RFC 1448</a> which defines the protocol used for network access to
         managed objects.

      The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
      experimentation and evaluation.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Object Definitions</span>

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Overview</span>

   In theory, the DNS world is pretty simple.  There are two kinds of
   entities: resolvers and name servers.  Resolvers ask questions.  Name
   servers answer them.  The real world, however, is not so simple.



<span class="grey">Austein &amp; Saperia                                               [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-3" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="/doc/html/rfc1611">RFC 1611</a>               DNS Server MIB Extensions                May 1994</span>


   Implementors have made widely differing choices about how to divide
   DNS functions between resolvers and servers.  They have also
   constructed various sorts of exotic hybrids.  The most difficult task
   in defining this MIB was to accommodate this wide range of entities
   without having to come up with a separate MIB for each.

   We divided up the various DNS functions into two, non-overlapping
   classes, called &quot;resolver functions&quot; and &quot;name server functions.&quot;  A
   DNS entity that performs what we define as resolver functions
   contains a resolver, and therefore must implement the MIB groups
   required of all resolvers which are defined in a separate MIB Module.
   A DNS entity which implements name server functions is considered to
   be a name server, and must implement the MIB groups required for name
   servers in this module.  If the same piece of software performs both
   resolver and server functions, we imagine that it contains both a
   resolver and a server and would thus implement both the DNS Server
   and DNS Resolver MIBs.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Resolvers</span>

   In our model, a resolver is a program (or piece thereof) which
   obtains resource records from servers.  Normally it does so at the
   behest of an application, but may also do so as part of its own
   operation.  A resolver sends DNS protocol queries and receives DNS
   protocol replies.  A resolver neither receives queries nor sends
   replies.  A full service resolver is one that knows how to resolve
   queries: it obtains the needed resource records by contacting a
   server authoritative for the records desired.  A stub resolver does
   not know how to resolve queries: it sends all queries to a local name
   server, setting the &quot;recursion desired&quot; flag to indicate that it
   hopes that the name server will be willing to resolve the query.  A
   resolver may (optionally) have a cache for remembering previously
   acquired resource records.  It may also have a negative cache for
   remembering names or data that have been determined not to exist.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Name Servers</span>

   A name server is a program (or piece thereof) that provides resource
   records to resolvers.  All references in this document to &quot;a name
   server&quot; imply &quot;the name server&#x27;s role&quot;; in some cases the name
   server&#x27;s role and the resolver&#x27;s role might be combined into a single
   program.  A name server receives DNS protocol queries and sends DNS
   protocol replies.  A name server neither sends queries nor receives
   replies.  As a consequence, name servers do not have caches.
   Normally, a name server would expect to receive only those queries to
   which it could respond with authoritative information.  However, if a
   name server receives a query that it cannot respond to with purely
   authoritative information, it may choose to try to obtain the



<span class="grey">Austein &amp; Saperia                                               [Page 3]</span></pre>

   necessary additional information from a resolver which may or may not
   be a separate process.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Selected Objects</span>

   Many of the objects included in this memo have been created from
   information contained in the DNS specifications [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;Domain Names -- Concepts and Facilities&quot;">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Domain Names -- Implementation and Specification&quot;">2</a>], as amended and
   clarified by subsequent host requirements documents [<a href="#ref-3" title="Editor">3</a>].  Other
   objects have been created based on experience with existing DNS
   management tools, expected operational needs, the statistics
   generated by existing DNS implementations, and the configuration
   files used by existing DNS implementations.  These objects have been
   ordered into groups as follows:

      o  Server Configuration Group

      o  Server Counter Group

      o  Server Optional Counter Group

      o  Server Zone Group

   This information has been converted into a standard form using the
   SNMPv2 SMI defined in [<a href="#ref-9" title="&quot;Structure of Management Information for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)&quot;">9</a>].  For the most part, the descriptions are
   influenced by the DNS related RFCs noted above.  For example, the
   descriptions for counters used for the various types of queries of
   DNS records are influenced by the definitions used for the various
   record types found in [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Domain Names -- Implementation and Specification&quot;">2</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Textual Conventions</span>

   Several conceptual data types have been introduced as a textual
   conventions in this DNS MIB document.  These additions will
   facilitate the common understanding of information used by the DNS.
   No changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to support these
   conventions.

   Readers familiar with MIBs designed to manage entities in the lower
   layers of the Internet protocol suite may be surprised at the number
   of non-enumerated integers used in this MIB to represent values such
   as DNS RR class and type numbers.  The reason for this choice is
   simple: the DNS itself is designed as an extensible protocol,
   allowing new classes and types of resource records to be added to the
   protocol without recoding the core DNS software.  Using non-
   enumerated integers to represent these data types in this MIB allows
   the MIB to accommodate these changes as well.

       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
               &quot;A DNS name is a sequence of labels.  When DNS names are
               displayed, the boundaries between labels are typically
               indicated by dots (e.g. `Acme&#x27; and `COM&#x27; are labels in
               the name `Acme.COM&#x27;).  In the DNS protocol, however, no
               such separators are needed because each label is encoded
               as a length octet followed by the indicated number of
               octets of label.  For example, `Acme.COM&#x27; is encoded as
               the octet sequence { 4, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;m&#x27;, &#x27;e&#x27;, 3, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;O&#x27;,
               &#x27;M&#x27;, 0 } (the final 0 is the length of the name of the
               root domain, which appears implicitly at the end of any
               DNS name).  This MIB uses the same encoding as the DNS
               protocol.

               A DnsName must always be a fully qualified name.  It is
               an error to encode a relative domain name as a DnsName
               without first making it a fully qualified name.&quot;

   DnsNameAsIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
               &quot;This textual convention is like a DnsName, but is used
               as an index componant in tables.  Alphabetic characters
               in names of this type are restricted to uppercase: the
               characters &#x27;a&#x27; through &#x27;z&#x27; are mapped to the characters
               &#x27;A&#x27; through &#x27;Z&#x27;.  This restriction is intended to make
               the lexical ordering imposed by SNMP useful when applied
               to DNS names.

               Note that it is theoretically possible for a valid DNS

   -- Server Optional Counter Group

   -- The Server Optional Counter Group is intended for those systems
   -- which make distinctions between the different sources of the DNS
   -- queries as defined below.
   --
   -- Objects in this group are implemented on servers which distinguish
   -- between queries which originate from the same host as the server,
   -- queries from one of an arbitrary group of hosts that are on an
   -- access list defined by the server, and queries from hosts that do
   -- not fit either of these descriptions.
   --
   -- The objects found in the Server Counter group are totals.  Thus if
   -- one wanted to identify, for example, the number of queries from
   -- `remote&#x27; hosts which have been given authoritative answers, one
   -- would subtract the current values of ServOptCounterFriendsAuthAns
   -- and ServOptCounterSelfAuthAns from servCounterAuthAns.
   --
   -- The purpose of these distinctions is to allow for implementations
   -- to group queries and responses on this basis.  One way in which
   -- servers may make these distinctions is by looking at the source IP
   -- address of the DNS query.  If the source of the query is `your
   -- own&#x27; then the query should be counted as `yourself&#x27; (local host).
   -- If the source of the query matches an `access list,&#x27; the query
   -- came from a friend.  What constitutes an `access list&#x27; is
   -- implementation dependent and could be as simple as a rule that all
   -- hosts on the same IP network as the DNS server are classed
   -- `friends.&#x27;
   --
   -- In order to avoid double counting, the following rules apply:
   --
   -- 1. No host is in more than one of the three groups defined above.
   --
   -- 2. All queries from the local host are always counted in the
   --    `yourself&#x27; group regardless of what the access list, if any,
   --    says.
   --
   -- 3. The access list should not define `your friends&#x27; in such a way
   --    that it includes all hosts.   That is, not everybody is your
   --    `friend.&#x27;
